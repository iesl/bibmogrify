                    <italic>Neurospora</italic>
                    Varkud Satellite (VS) RNA is capable of promoting a reversible self-cleavage reaction important for
                    its replication pathway.
                    <italic>In vivo</italic>
                    the VS RNA performs a<italic>cis</italic>-cleavage reaction to generate monomeric length transcripts
                    that are subsequently ligated to produce circular VS RNA. The predominant form of VS RNA observed
                    <italic>in vivo</italic>
                    is the closed circular form, though minimal VS ribozyme self-cleavage constructs lack detectable
                    ligation activity. MFOLD analysis of the entire VS RNA sequence revealed an extended region 5&#x02032;
                    and 3&#x02032; of the minimal self-cleaving region that could anneal to form a complementary helix,
                    which we have termed helix 7. In full-length VS RNA, this helix appears to span over 40 bp of
                    sequence and brings the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the RNA into proximity for the ligation
                    reaction. Here we report a variant of the VS ribozyme with an extended 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-terminus
                    capable of forming a truncated helix 7 that promotes the ligation reaction<italic>in vitro</italic>.
                    Through mutation and selection of this RNA we have identified a ribozyme containing two point
                    mutations in the truncated helix 7 that ligates with &#x0003e;70&#x00025; efficiency. These results
                    show that an additional helical element absent in current VS ribozyme constructs is likely to be
                    important for the ligation activity of VS RNA.

            <p>The
                <italic>Neurospora</italic>
                Varkud Satellite (VS) RNA is an abundant non-coding RNA found in the mitochondria of certain natural
                isolates of the species
                <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>
                (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c1">1</xref>).
                <italic>In vivo</italic>
                VS RNA exists as a satellite RNA of the V plasmid, a large mitochondrial DNA that encodes a reverse
                transcriptase necessary for replication of the VS RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c2">2</xref>).
                The VS RNA contains a catalytic element capable of a reversible self-cleavage reaction. Like most small
                satellite RNA molecules, VS is thought to replicate by rolling circle replication (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                         rid="gke666c3">
                    3</xref>). Initially, VS RNA is synthesized as a multimeric transcript transcribed from the VS
                plasmid DNA. A site-specific cleavage event produces linear monomeric and some multimeric length
                transcripts that are ligated to produce circular VS RNA, the predominant form of VS observed
                <italic>in vivo</italic>
                (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c4">4</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>The VS ribozyme, encoded within the VS RNA, is a small catalytic motif that catalyzes a site-specific
                cleavage reaction generating products containing 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate and 5&#x02032;-OH
                termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c4">4</xref>). The reaction is mechanistically similar to
                other small catalytic RNAs, including the hammerhead, hairpin and hepatitis delta virus ribozymes (<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c5">5</xref>). VS RNA itself is 881 nt in length, however, the
                minimal contiguous sequence required for self-cleavage consists of only 154 nt, a single nucleotide
                upstream and 153 nt downstream of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c6">6</xref>). The
                secondary structure of this minimal self-cleaving construct (clone G11), based on RNA folding programs
                and biochemical data, is arranged as a set of six helical elements (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                          rid="gke666c7">7</xref>). A 3
                bp long-range pseudoknot formed between the loops of helices 1 and 5 is also required for folding and
                activity of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c7">7</xref>). While clone G11 represents the
                minimal self-cleaving domain, it is not capable of the reverse (ligation) reaction
                <italic>in vitro</italic>
                (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c8">8</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that sequence elements essential
                for ligation may be absent from this construct. In an attempt to define elements necessary for ligation,
                the sequence at the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the RNA were analyzed, revealing a long region of
                base pair complementarity. Based upon biochemical analysis of several ribozyme constructs we demonstrate
                that formation of this seventh helical element is critical for the ligation activity of the VS ribozyme.

                    EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. Transcripts were concentrated by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in
                    an appropriate volume of TE (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Transcription reactions

                <p>The pVS6 plasmid contains VS nucleotides 599&#x02013;791 (numbering based upon that of Saville and
                    Collins;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c4">4</xref>). VS6 RNA was prepared by transcription of
                    <italic>Eco</italic>RI-cut pVS6. The pVSE plasmid also contains VS nucleotides 599&#x02013;791, with
                    mutations A782U and U785C incorporated via site-directed mutagenesis. The VS6 clone contains some
                    vector sequence at the 3&#x02032;-end, however, the VSE clone was designed with an<italic>
                        Ear</italic>I restriction site at the 3&#x02032;-end that can be used to generate full-length
                    VSE RNA. VSE RNA was prepared by transcription of pVSE cut with<italic>Ear</italic>I. The G11
                    plasmid contains VS nucleotides 617&#x02013;881 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c6">6</xref>). G11
                    RNA was prepared by transcription of G11 linearized with<italic>Ssp</italic>I. Substrate RNA, SUB13,
                    was prepared by transcription from a G11-<italic>Ava</italic>I template, and 5&#x02032;-end-labeled
                    as described below. SUB24 RNA was prepared by transcription of either<italic>Eco</italic>RI-cut pVS6
                    or<italic>Ava</italic>I-cut pVS6 (for 5&#x02032;-end-labeling). The compensatory substrate, SUB24M,
                    was prepared by transcription of plasmid 5A linearized with<italic>Ava</italic>I (plasmid 5A
                    contains VS nucleotides 599&#x02013;791, with mutations G604C, A605U and G606C). Transcription of
                    pVS6-<italic>Eco</italic>RI followed by self-cleavage yielded the SUB24 substrate with a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic
                    phosphate terminus. Transcription of pVS6-<italic>Ava</italic>I, pG11-<italic>Ava</italic>I or p5A-
                    <italic>Ava</italic>I yielded stem&#x02013;loop I substrates which could be 5&#x02032;-end-labeled
                    and then cleaved by the VS<italic>trans</italic>-cleaving ribozyme to generate the oligonucleotide
                    substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c9">9</xref>). Concentrations of unlabeled transcripts
                    were determined by UV absorption assuming an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 2.2 &#x000d7; 10
                    <sup>6</sup>
                    for VS6 or VSE RNA, and 2.6 &#x000d7; 10
                    <sup>5</sup>
                    for substrate RNAs.
                </p>
                <p>The<italic>Ava</italic>I substrate RNA was 5&#x02032;-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4
                    PNK) and &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP. After labeling the RNA at 37&#x000b0;C for
                    45 min, the kinase was heat inactivated at 70&#x000b0;C for 20 min. The<sup>32</sup>P-5&#x02032;-end-labeled
                    <italic>Ava</italic>I RNA was then cleaved with VS<italic>trans</italic>-cleaving ribozyme at 30&#x000b0;C
                    for 1 h to generate the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate end. Products were resolved on a 20&#x00025;
                    native polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography and eluted by the crush-and-soak method at
                    4&#x000b0;C in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl and 0.1 mM EDTA. This procedure enabled efficient 5&#x02032;-end-labeling
                    of the substrate RNA while avoiding the 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activity of T4 PNK.

                <title>Ligation reactions</title>
                <p>Ligation reactions were performed at 30&#x000b0;C in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>
                    2</sub>, 25 mM KCl and 2 mM spermidine. The ribozyme (0.5 &#x000b5;M) was preincubated at 50&#x000b0;C
                    for 30 min and slow cooled, followed by an additional 10 min incubation at 30&#x000b0;C. Ligation
                    reactions were initiated by addition of a pre-warmed solution of labeled substrate RNA and incubated
                    at 30&#x000b0;C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 2 vol formamide loading buffer. Products
                    were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. For
                    characterization of VSE and mutant RNAs, ligation reactions were performed as described using 0.5
                    &#x000b5;M ribozyme and trace amounts of labeled substrate (&#x0223c;10 nM). Aliquots were removed
                    at various times and quenched in 2 vol formamide loading buffer, and reaction products were resolved
                    by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The amounts of radioactivity in the substrate and product bands

                    plotted and analyzed using KaleidaGraph software. Initial rates were determined based on a linear
                    fit of the data.

                <title>Pool construction and selection assay</title>
                <p>The initial randomized pool was constructed from two degenerate oligonucleotides, VS-3D and VS-5D,
                    and their complements, VS-3 and VS-5, respectively, which span the full length of the VS6 ribozyme
                    sequence. The pool was designed to give a degeneracy level of 7.5&#x00025;, yielding an expected
                    mutation rate of 12&#x02013;14 mutations per molecule. The oligonucleotides were purified by 8&#x00025;
                    denaturing PAGE, extracted by the crush-and-soak method, concentrated with ethanol and resuspended
                    in an appropriate volume of TE. Degenerate oligonucleotides, VS-3D and VS-5D, were annealed at 90&#x000b0;C
                    to their complements, VS-3 and VS-5, respectively, and slow cooled to room temperature. The
                    double-stranded templates, each comprising the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the pool, were
                    then digested with<italic>Bsa</italic>I and ligated with T4 DNA ligase at 16&#x000b0;C to give
                    full-length Pool 0 DNA. Pool 0 DNA was engineered with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5&#x02032;-end
                    and a primer binding site (PBS 1B) at the 3&#x02032;-end. Pool 0 RNA was transcribed
                    <italic>in vitro</italic>
                    using T7 RNA polymerase and self-cleavage products purified by 8&#x00025; denaturing PAGE. The RNA
                    was extracted by the crush-and-soak method at 4&#x000b0;C, concentrated by ethanol precipitation and
                    resuspended in an appropriate volume of TE.
                </p>
                <p>Ligation reactions were conducted as described above. The initial round of selection contained 1.0
                    &#x000b5;M Pool 0 RNA (&#x0223c;10
                    <sup>12</sup>
                    molecules) and a 2 &#x000b5;M solution of labeled and unlabeled SUB24 RNA, although in subsequent
                    rounds the amount of substrate RNA was dropped to 0.5 &#x000b5;M. Ligated RNA was purified by 8&#x00025;
                    denaturing PAGE, visualized by autoradiography and extracted by the crush-and-soak method. The RNA
                    was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in an appropriate volume of TE and reverse
                    transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) with primer SLX1B, d(CGTGCGGATCCCTCTTCG),
                    complementary to the 3&#x02032;-end of the RNA. The AMV-RT was then heat inactivated at 90&#x000b0;C
                    for 5 min and the reaction products PCR amplified using primers SLX1B and SLX3A,
                    d(GCAAGCTTATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTAGTAGAGTGTCGCAATCTGCG), to regenerate the pool (Fig.<xref
                            ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f2">2</xref>). RNA was prepared as described for Pool 0 RNA. The
                    protocol was repeated for subsequent rounds of selection. The ligation efficiency of individual
                    pools was determined using the ligation assay described above. Pool 3 DNA, representing the most
                    active pool, was digested with<italic>Eco</italic>RI and<italic>Hin</italic>dIII and cloned into

                    transcription of plasmids linearized with<italic>Ear</italic>I. Self-cleavage products were purified

                    resuspended in TE. Individual clones were tested for ligation activity using the ligation assay
                    described above and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing.

            <title>RESULTS</title>
            <p>The majority of VS RNA isolated
                <italic>in vivo</italic>
                is in the closed circular form, suggesting that the internal equilibrium of this RNA favors ligation
                over cleavage. The minimal self-cleaving VS ribozyme construct (G11) provides only a short 3 bp helix
                for substrate binding interactions and this may explain why it is unable to efficiently ligate a
                complementary oligonucleotide substrate. The fact that full-length VS RNA can perform the reverse
                (ligation) reaction to generate circular products suggests that this minimal self-cleaving ribozyme may
                lack essential elements required for ligation activity.
            </p>
            <p>In an effort to identify sequence elements that may stabilize substrate&#x02013;ribozyme interactions and
                promote ligation activity
                <italic>in vitro</italic>
                we conducted an MFOLD analysis of the entire VS RNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c10">
                    10</xref>). MFOLD (v.2.1) revealed an extended region of complementarity 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;
                to the minimal self-cleaving domain. This extended helix, termed helix 7, appears to extend over 40 bp
                of VS RNA sequence (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f1">1</xref>). The putative helix consists of a
                long region of complementarity between 5&#x02032; nucleotides G564&#x02013;A614 and 3&#x02032;
                nucleotides U774&#x02013;U828. The helix 7 extension includes a few short mispaired regions and several
                non-canonical G-U base pairs, but as many as 34 standard Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs. These features
                appear to make helix 7 very stable, with a calculated
                <italic>T</italic>
                <sub>m</sub>
                of 75&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c10">10</xref>). We reasoned that this element may be
                important for ligation activity by aligning the substrate on the ribozyme and thus may play an important
                biological role.
            </p>
            <p>To examine the potential contribution of this helix to VS ribozyme ligation activity several constructs
                were designed, each containing a truncated version of helix 7. One construct (VS6, Fig.<xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f1">1</xref>), which contained an 8 nt extension to the 3&#x02032;-end
                of the original VS ribozyme, was capable of ligating
                <italic>in trans</italic>
                a complementary oligonucleotide substrate (SUB24) that contained a 22 nt extension to the 5&#x02032;-end
                of the cleavage site. Ligation of VS6 to SUB24, however, proceeded with an efficiency of only 2&#x00025;.
                Gel shift analysis revealed that VS6 RNA bound the oligonucleotide substrate very poorly (&#x0003c;5&#x00025;;
                data not shown). Further analysis by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that VS6 adopted
                multiple folding conformations (data not shown). This suggested that the low level ligation activity of
                this RNA may have resulted from structural heterogeneity and that the 3&#x02032; extension necessary for
                substrate binding may have been inaccessible, thus inhibiting ligation.
            </p>
            <p>In order to identify an RNA construct with a truncated helix 7 that contained a minimal number of
                mutations yet could fold more readily and ligate a complementary oligonucleotide substrate with greater
                efficiency, we employed the technique of
                <italic>in vitro</italic>
                selection. Similar methods have been adapted to isolate ribozymes from random sequence, as well as to
                define essential sequence elements of naturally occurring ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                           rid="gke666c11">11</xref>,
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c12">12</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>A randomized pool of VS6 DNA was designed with a degeneracy level of 7.5&#x00025;, expected to yield an
                average mutation rate of 12&#x02013;14 mutations per molecule. The randomized pool was constructed from
                two degenerate oligonucleotides, VS-3D and VS-5D, comprising the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the
                VS6 sequence. This enabled us to randomize the entire region of VS6 sequence (nucleotides 621&#x02013;791),
                with the exception of nucleotides 691&#x02013;694 in helix 5, which were used to anneal the respective
                oligonucleotides together during generation of the initial pool. A T7 RNA polymerase promoter was
                engineered at the 5&#x02032;-end of the sequence to facilitate
                <italic>in vitro</italic>
                transcription, as well as a selective primer binding site (PBS 1B) at the 3&#x02032;-end.
            </p>
            <p>The selection and amplification scheme is outlined in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f2">2</xref>.
                Active variants were selected based upon their ability to ligate
                <italic>in trans</italic>
                an oligonucleotide substrate (SUB24). The initial RNA pool (Pool 0) had a ligation efficiency of 0.1&#x00025;,
                however, after three rounds of selection the overall ligation efficiency of the RNA pool improved to 10&#x00025;
                (Table
                <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke666tb1">1</xref>
                and Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f3">3</xref>). This corresponds to a 100-fold enhancement
                compared to the original Pool 0 RNA and a 5-fold enhancement compared to wild-type VS6 RNA. Several
                members of this pool were cloned and sequenced. Individual ligation efficiencies were determined based
                on the ability of the RNA to ligate 5&#x02032;-end-labeled SUB24 in 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C. Several
                active clones were identified, the two most active of which, S24 and S90, had ligation efficiencies of
                32 and 18&#x00025; in 30 min, respectively (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f4">4</xref>). S24 and
                S90 both had a mutation at position G627 in helix 1B, mutations in the 3&#x02032;-segment of helix 7 and
                several unrelated mutations scattered throughout the RNA (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f4">
                    4</xref>). Many other active selected RNAs also contained mutations in the 3&#x02032;-segment of
                helix 7, which suggested that these mutations may be contributing to the increased ligation efficiency
                of these constructs (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f4">4</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>To determine which mutations were responsible for the improved VS ribozyme ligation activity, three
                additional RNA constructs were prepared containing mutations commonly observed among the active
                population. Although a G627 mutation was present in both variants S24 and S90, mutating G627 to C showed
                only a modest improvement in the total ligation activity (&#x0003c;4&#x00025;) compared to VS6. The
                G627U mutation had a reduced ligation efficiency of 1&#x00025;. To assess a potential role for mutations
                observed in helix 7, an additional construct, termed VSE, was created that contained the two helix 7
                mutations, A782U and U785C, observed in the most active clone, S24. VSE RNA was able to ligate a
                complementary substrate (SUB24) with an efficiency of 30&#x00025; in 30 min, compared to 32&#x00025; for
                S24. Further characterization found that VSE RNA ligates with an efficiency exceeding 70&#x00025; in 4
                h, with an initial rate constant of 1.6 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Ribozymes containing each of the
                single helix 7 mutations were also prepared. The U785C mutant (1A) had a maximal ligation efficiency of
                35&#x00025; after 6 h, with an initial rate constant of 0.64 min
                <sup>&#x02013;1</sup>
                (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="gke666tb2">2</xref>). The ligation efficiency of the A782U mutant (2B)
                did not exceed 10&#x00025; efficiency and had an initial rate constant of only 0.09 min
                <sup>&#x02013;1</sup>
                (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="gke666tb2">2</xref>). Thus, while the majority of the improved
                ligation activity appears to derive from the U785C mutation, both mutations are required for optimal
                efficiency of the ribozyme.
            </p>
            <p>The importance of helix 7 in VS RNA ligation activity was further examined by looking at the effect on
                ligation activity of RNA constructs that lacked either the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; extension required
                to form helix 7. To this end we utilized the G11 RNA, i.e. the original VS ribozyme that lacks the 3&#x02032;
                extension of helix 7, and a shorter substrate (SUB13) which lacks the 5&#x02032; extension of helix 7.
                SUB13 contains only 4 nt of wild-type VS sequence and is capable of forming only a short 3 bp helix with
                the ribozyme. In the absence of either the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; extension, ligation activity was
                reduced to &#x0003c;1&#x00025; efficiency, suggesting that neither the 3&#x02032; nor the 5&#x02032;
                extension alone are sufficient to confer ligation activity (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="gke666tb3">
                    3</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>To investigate the importance of the alignment of helix 7 proposed in Figure<xref ref-type="fig"
                                                                                                 rid="gke666f1">1</xref>
                , we designed a ribozyme (3B, Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f1">1</xref>) containing mutations in
                the 3&#x02032; extension of helix 7 expected to disrupt predicted base pairing interactions. The mutant
                ribozyme 3B ligates substrate SUB24 with reduced efficiency (&#x0003c;10&#x00025;), at a rate &#x0003e;20-fold
                slower than the initial rate of VSE (0.07 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, Table<xref ref-type="table"
                                                                                               rid="gke666tb2">2</xref>
                ). However, if the compensatory mutations are made in the substrate (SUB24M, Fig.<xref ref-type="fig"
                                                                                                       rid="gke666f1">
                    1</xref>) then the mutant ribozyme is capable of a ligation efficiency very close to that of the
                wild-type construct (40&#x00025;, initial rate 1.8 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). This provides direct
                evidence for base pairing interactions between at least this segment of the helix 7 region.

            <title>DISCUSSION</title>
            <p>We have described the identification and initial characterization of a putative helical element in the VS
                RNA secondary structure that appears to serve an important role in VS ligation activity. Helix 7 may
                play a biological role in VS RNA ligation activity by properly aligning the substrate on the ribozyme to
                facilitate ligation. Self-cleaving constructs lacking this helix were incapable of ligation activity (&#x0003c;1&#x00025;),
                although recent circular permutation constructs of VS RNA have provided alternative means to achieve
                ligation activity
                <italic>in vitro</italic>
                (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c13">13</xref>). These circular permutated constructs, in which stem 1
                is covalently linked to the 3&#x02032;-end of G11 RNA, exploit the fact that VS RNA exists
                <italic>in vivo</italic>
                as head-to-tail multimers to align the substrate and ribozyme in close proximity.
            </p>
            <p>Based on MFOLD analysis helix 7 appears to span a significant amount of the total VS RNA sequence. The
                presence of this extended region of complementarity may contribute binding energy to stabilize substrate&#x02013;ribozyme
                interactions and maintain closed circular products<italic>in vivo</italic>. The VS6 ribozyme identified
                in this study contains only a truncated portion of the wild-type helix 7 and is capable of ligation
                activity. Through mutation and selection we have identified a highly efficient VS ligation construct
                with a significantly shorter helix than is likely present in the full-length VS RNA. VSE RNA contains
                only two mutations in the helix 7 region and ligates with an efficiency exceeding 70&#x00025;. These
                results suggest that the internal equilibrium of VSE ribozyme favors ligation over cleavage, as is the
                case for the VS RNA.
            </p>
            <p>The two helix 7 mutations, A782U and U785C, could either play a role in promoting the properly folded RNA
                conformation or they may directly stabilize interactions with the substrate in order to promote greater
                ligation efficiency. Both mutations appear to be important for ligation activity, though the U785C
                mutation makes the greatest contribution. The U785C mutation converts a G-U base pair to a G-C base
                pair, which may contribute additional stability to the helix. It is unclear how the A782U mutation makes
                its modest contribution to the ligation activity of the RNA. These mutations do not increase ligation
                activity in the absence of their complementary sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end, demonstrating that the 3&#x02032;
                extension of helix 7 alone is not sufficient for ligation activity.
            </p>
            <p>Based upon sequence alignments and chemical probing data we propose that helix 7 exists in equilibrium
                between two alternative conformations. In one conformation a weak helix 7 is formed that would exhibit
                poor substrate interactions (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f5">5</xref>, left). In the alternative
                conformation a stronger helix 7 is formed that would allow better substrate binding interactions and
                thus increased ligation activity (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f5">5</xref>, right). In switching
                between these two conformations, base pairing interactions in helix 2 are also disrupted (Fig.<xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="gke666f5">5</xref>, right). This is consistent with modification
                interference experiments that previously demonstrated that disruptions in helix 2, achieved through
                reaction of base functional groups with hydrazine or DEPC, enhanced self-cleavage activity of the
                ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c8">8</xref>). This region of secondary structure has been
                implicated as part of a VS attenuator structure evolved to affect the cleavage and ligation equilibrium
                of VS RNA and to promote the formation of closed circular products
                <italic>in vivo</italic>
                (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke666c8">8</xref>). While the precise base pairs that are formed within
                helix 7 and disrupted in helix 2 remain to be determined, these results clearly demonstrate that RNA
                sequence to the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-sides of the traditionally defined boundaries of the VS
                ribozyme are important for its RNA ligation activity.

                        ligation is indicated by an arrow. The RNA consists of seven helical regions (helices 1A&#x02013;7).
                        Base paired regions in the ribozyme are indicated by horizontal and vertical lines, while base
                        pairing interactions in helix 7 are shown. The VS6 ribozyme contains a truncated version of
                        helix 7, however, in full-length VS RNA helix 7 may extend over 40 bp of sequence (boxed
                        region). Wild-type sequence is denoted in upper case and vector sequence in lower case. The VSE
                        ribozyme contains two helix 7 mutations, U785C and A782U (shaded circles), that are observed to
                        enhance ligation activity. Mutations in ribozyme 3B and compensatory mutations in SUB24M (used
                        to demonstrate the helix 7 specificity switch) are indicated. In addition to the mutations
                        indicated, ribozyme 3B also contains the A782U mutation.

                        containing a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate terminus. Active RNAs ligate the
                        oligonucleotide substrate and become sequence tagged at their 5&#x02032;-end. Active variants
                        were size selected from inactive variants by denaturing gel electrophoresis, reverse transcribed
                        and PCR amplified with selective primers (SLX 1B and SLX 3A) to reintroduce the T7 promoter and
                        regenerate the pool. The scheme was repeated for subsequent rounds of selection.
