FIELD Title:Quantum kinetic theory of phonon-assisted carrier transitions in nitride-based quantum-dot systems.
FIELD Accession Number:AN 2005:1064768
FIELD Abstract:A microscopic theory for the interaction of carriers with LO phonons is used to study the ultrafast carrier dynamics in nitride-based semiconductor quantum dots.  It is shown that the efficiency of scattering processes is directly linked to quasi-particle renormalizations.  The electronic states of the interacting system are strongly modified by the combined influence of quantum confinement and polar coupling.  Inherent electrostatic fields, typical for InGaN/GaN quantum dots, do not limit the fast scattering channels. [on SciFinder (R)]

FIELD Title:Photon-Modulated Wettability Changes on Spiropyran-Coated Surfaces.
FIELD Accession Number:AN 2002:661530
FIELD Abstract:A coating of photoresponsive spiropyran mols. covalently bound to a glass surface along with a mixt. of organosilanes to control the surface environment was prepd.  The relatively nonpolar spiropyran can be reversibly switched to a polar, zwitterionic merocyanine isomer that has a much larger dipole moment by UV light, and back again by visible light.  The contact angle was 11 Deg-14 Deg lower for dry, spiropyran-coated surfaces after irradn. with UV than that for dry, spiropyran-coated surfaces after irradn. with visible light.  The light-induced changes obsd. in the surface energy were correlated to the switching of the surface-bound spiropyran mol. between polar and nonpolar forms by means of fluorescence spectroscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.  Water in capillary tubes coated with the photosensitive layer was obsd. to rise when the wavelength of incident light was switched from visible to UV.  The UV-induced rise was of the order of 2.8 mm for a 500 mm diam. capillary.  This microfluidic actuation of water in an enclosed capillary or microchannel using light is termed \"photocapillarity\".  Contact angle hysteresis prevented the water from flowing back down the capillary when the light was switched from UV back to visible. [on SciFinder (R)]

FIELD Title:Nonequilibrium many-body effects in semiconductor microlasers.
FIELD Accession Number:AN 1995:432898
FIELD Abstract:The improved semiconductor manufg. capabilities make it possible to produce tiny semiconductor lasers with micrometer cavity dimensions.  Ideally, these microlasers are the optical analogy of micromasers, which allow experimentalists to study many aspects of quantum cavity electrodynamics.  The authors review, with 29 refs., the quantum mech. theory of semiconductor microlasers.  The authors analyze the coupled system of carriers and photons under laser conditions applying a microscopic theory that describes the spectral interplay of stimulated and spontaneous emission and the cavity loss.  The nonequil. dynamics of the carrier system is modelled by a Boltzmann equation which includes carrier-photon, carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering.  The authors numerically evaluate the theory to analyze the microlaser switch-on dynamics, development of lasing out of spontaneous emission, dynamic and stationary nonequil. carrier distributions, carrier heating through pumping and lasing, and the effects resulting from the increased coupling efficiency of the spontaneous emission into the laser mode.

FIELD Title:Ion-exchange equilibria and diffusion in engineered backfill.
FIELD Accession Number:AN 1985:549309
FIELD Abstract:The design and operation are discussed of a unique radial-flow diffusion cell to det. ion migration rates in backfill material under realistic repository conditions.  New exptl. results were reported for diffusion of CsCl in a background of NaCl into compacted bentonite and bentonite/quartz mixts.  Representation of the measured diffusion rates by the traditional, homogeneous porous-medium model significantly underestimates Cs penetration distances into the backfill.  Surface diffusion is suggested as an addnl. mechanism by which cations transport in swollen montmorillonite; the surface diffusion coeffs. for Cs is .apprx.10-7 cm2/s.  An electrostatic site-binding model was developed for ion-exchange equil. on montmorillonite clay.  The effects of pH, ionic strength, and specific adsorption were evaluated and compared favorably to new, exptl. exchange isotherms measured on disaggregated clay.  The electrostatic site-binding model permits a prediction of the influence of backfill compaction on Kd values.  For strongly adsorbing cations, compactions has little effect.  However, anions exhibit significant Donnan exclusion with clay compaction. [on SciFinder (R)]

FIELD Title:Clinical and bacteriological investigations on Entamastyl-dried cows.

FIELD Abstract:Entamastyl (composed of erythromycin (I) [114-07-8], framycetin, and diaphenylsulfone (II) [80-08-0], 1:1.5:100) was introduced into the udders of black and white cows producing 3-12 l. milk/day, 6-7 weeks before calving.  Drying up of milk production was obtained in all cases, without udder damage.  The no. of cows with chronic, clin. undetectable streptococcal infection of the udder mucosa was reduced 3-4-fold by the antibiotic.  Similarly, the no. of cows or udder sections obviously infected with possible mastitis organisms was reduced 5-6-fold. [on SciFinder (R)]
