AB Eggs and larvae of Baltic sprat Sprattus sprattus L. were collected
   during 14 cruises covering the spawning season in 2002 in Bornholm
   Basin. Main egg and larval production was in April, with a second small
   peak in June 2002. The in situ larval abundance was corrected for
   transport processes by hydrodynamic model runs. Corrected larval
   abundance estimates were compared to initial larval production to
   derive an index of larval mortality. This index suggested a much higher
   survival of summer-over spring-born sprat larvae, with pronounced
   differences in survival for larvae > 11 mm. Independent evidence for
   this survival pattern was gained by measured RNA:DNA ratios in sprat
   larvae hatched from April to July 2002 and was linked to temporal
   variability in potential prey abundance. We found higher mean but less
   variable RNA:DNA ratios in spring- than in summer-born larvae,
   indicating a strong selection for fast growth in April and May but a
   less selective environment in June and July. Zooplankton data revealed
   high naupliar concentrations of Acartia spp. (a key dietary component
   of sprat) in April and May, but very low concentrations of larger prey
   items such as copepodites or adults. In contrast, abundance of larger
   prey increased considerably in June and July. The results suggest that
   larger sprat (> 11 mm) in April and May 2002 may have been food limited
   and, therefore, had lower rates of survival, supporting the underlying
   hypothesis of size-specific, temporally limited 'windows of survival'
   linked to the availability of suitable prey.

AB Large-scale climatic conditions prevailing over the central Baltic Sea
   resulted in declining salinity and oxygen concentrations in spawning
   areas of the eastern Baltic cod stock. These changes in hydrography
   reduced the reproductive success and, combined with high fishing
   pressure, caused a decline of the stock to the lowest level on record
   in the early 1990s. The present Study aims at disentangling the
   interactions between reproductive effort and hydrographic forcing
   leading to variable recruitment. Based on identified key processes,
   stock dynamics is explained Using updated environmental and life
   stage-specific abundance and production time-series. Declining
   salinities and oxygen concentrations caused high egg mortalities and
   indirectly increased egg predation by clupeid fish. Low recruitment,
   despite enhanced hydrographic conditions for egg survival in the
   mid-1990s, was due to food limitation for larvae, caused by the decline
   in the abundance of the copepod Pseudocalanus sp. The case of the
   eastern Baltic cod stock exemplifies the multitude effects climatic
   variability may have oil a fish stock and underscores the importance of
   knowledge of these processes for understanding stock dynamics. (c) 2005

AB Transport of Baltic sprat Sprattus sprattus L. larvae spawned on
   different spawning grounds was investigated by detailed drift model
   simulations for the years 1979-2002. Modeling approaches with and
   without diurnal vertical migration were applied. We used recently
   collected data on spawning location, vertical distribution and the
   timing of spawning as input to a particle tracking model. Results of
   this modeling study enabled the identification of potential nursery
   grounds for sprat originating from different spawning grounds. On
   average, westerly winds are prevailing over the Baltic Sea. This leads
   to on average higher abundance of juvenile sprat along the southern and
   the eastern coast lines of the Baltic. The horizontal distribution of
   simulated larval or 0-group sprat is consistent with the observed
   distribution of 0-group sprat obtained from the hydroacoustic field
   surveys.
   In addition, this analysis identifies the potential for advective
   mixing between juveniles originating from different spawning sites or
   from the same spawning site throughout the spawning season. High
   spatial overlap was found between Arkona-and Bornholm Basin larvae
   hatched at the beginning of the spawning season. Mixing probability of
   sprat juveniles between Arkona-and Gotland Basin as well as between
   Bornholm- and Gotland Basin were on relatively low levels. (c) 2005

AB Temporal mismatch between the occurrence of larvae and their prey
   potentially affects the spatial overlap and thus the contact rates
   between predator and prey. This might have important consequences for
   growth and survival. We performed a case study investigating the
   influence of circulation patterns on the overlap of Baltic cod larvae
   with their prey. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to
   analyse spatio-temporally resolved drift patterns of larval Baltic cod.
   A coefficient of overlap between modelled larval and idealized prey
   distributions indicated the probability of predator-prey overlap,
   dependent on the hatching time of cod larvae. By performing model runs
   for the years 1979-1998 investigated the intra- and interannual
   variability of potential spatial overlap between predator and prey.
   Assuming uniform prey distributions, we generally found the overlap to
   have decreased since the mid-1980s, but with the highest variability
   during the 1990s. Seasonally, predator-prey overlap on the Baltic cod
   spawning grounds was highest in summer and lowest at the end of the cod
   spawning season. Horizontally variable prey distributions generally
   resulted in decreased overlap coefficients. Finally, we related
   variations in overlap patterns to the variability of Baltic cod
   recruitment success. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration
