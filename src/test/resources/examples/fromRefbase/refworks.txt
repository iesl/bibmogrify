AB Explored the relationship between self-report measures of anger and anger expression with those of social rank (unfavorable social comparison and submissive behavior) and feelings of entrapment in a student population (197 Ss, mean age 23.4 yrs). The authors further investigated if the social rank/status of the target of one's anger affects anger experience and expression. Students were given C. D. Spielberger's (1988) State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory measure of anger and asked to complete it in 3 ways. First, in the normal way, and then 2 further times after reading 2 scenarios that involved lending an important and needed book which the lender fails to return, where the lender was either an up rank/authority figure (one's tutor) or a down rank, fellow student. It was found that self-perceptions of unfavorable rank (inferior self-perceptions and submissive behavior) and feeling trapped significantly affect anger suppression. It was also found that the rank of the target significantly affects anger expression and that people who respond angrily to criticism tend to show more down rank-anger when they are frustrated by a lower rank target and modulate their anger according to the rank of the person they are angry with.

T1 Effect of a case management intervention on symptoms of asthma in high risk children

AB Statement of the problem. One approach to addressing the health care needs of patients with chronic medical problems is case management. Little is known about the effectiveness of case management in the treatment of children with asthma. Few randomized controlled studies of asthma case management have been conducted. In these studies, follow-up was limited to a one-year period. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a one-year primary-care based asthma case management (ACM) strategy on symptoms of asthma in high risk children at 15 and 18 months post-intervention. Methods. Twenty-eight parent caregivers of children with asthma aged 1 to 15 years, who participated in the ACM intervention the year prior to the start of this study, agreed to participate. The ACM group (n = 15) received one year of asthma case management and the usual care (UC) group (n = 13) received one year of routine outpatient care. Results. Child asthma symptoms, affects on parent lifestyle, and health system utilization were assessed. Based on caregiver four-week recall, the ACM group experienced fewer annual wheezing days compared to the UC group. 25.17 (36.55) versus 71.61 (80.01) that was statistically significant (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences between the ACM and UC groups in the cumulative 18-month estimate of child night-time coughing and awakening, parent night-time awakening due to the child's asthma symptoms and worrying, parent change in plans and missed work, and asthma-related physician office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Conclusion. A primary-care based asthma case management intervention was effective in reducing annual wheezing days in high-risk children with asthma when followed up to 18 months.

AB (From the cover) Imagine finding a way to reduce the amount of time you spend in doctors' offices, and to decrease the discomfort, depression, and anxiety associated with chronic pain. This book offers a program designed to help you develop skills for coping with pain so you can enjoy a fuller life. Carefully developed over the authors's many years of working with chronic pain sufferers, this program has been proven effective. Program participants report that they have been able to tale control of their pain and cut their their doctors's visits by more than 1/3. This hands-on guide provides detailed information with step-by-step techniques and activities designed to help you: (1) understand chronic pain, (2) recognize factors that increase or decrease pain, (3) reduce stress, (4) learn effective problem solving, (5) learn about medications and their effects, (6) develop relaxation and exercise techniques, (7) communicate effectively about your pain, and (8) set realistic goals. This revised edition features updated coverage of commonly used pain medications and specific disorders, current nutritional recommendations, and a new appendix on complementary alternative medicine. Also included are helpful new ideas on coping with pain flare-ups, staying active, accomplishing personal goals, and more. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2000 APA, all rights reserved)

AB The Minimum Degree algorithm, one of the classical algorithms of sparse matrix computations, is widely used to order graphs to reduce the work and storage needed to solve sparse systems of linear equations. There has been extensive research involving practical implementations of this algorithm over the past two decades. However, little has been done to establish theoretical bounds on the computational complexity of these implementations. We study the Minimum Degree algorithm, and prove time complexity bounds for its widely used variants.

AB (From the chapter) This chapter discusses the evidence for the proposition that depression is an aetiological factor in coronary heart disease, and 2 of the possible pathways by which this might occur: 1 in which social factors predict coronary heart disease, and depression and its associated psychophysiological changes are an intervening step; and the 2nd in which social factors predict coronary heart disease and depression, but depression is not on the pathway. This is followed by a discussion of anxiety as an aetiological factor in coronary heart disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved)
