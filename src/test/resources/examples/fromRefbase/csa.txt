AB: Abstract
    A three-dimensional physical oceanographic model was used to simulate
    the temporal evolution of ichthyoplankton distributions in the
    Bornholm Basin, Baltic Sea. The Bornholm Basin is one of the major
    spawning grounds for cod (Gadus morhua callarias L.) and sprat
    (Sprattus sprattus balticus S.) in the Baltic Sea with a large number
    of historic survey data as well as material from ongoing
    investigations being available. The aim of the present study was to
    investigate the quantitative influence of different factors on
    abundance estimates of early life stages (eggs and larvae) of cod and
    sprat. Influences under consideration were advective losses,
    uncertainty due to non-sufficient spatial sampling resolution (e.g.
    number of stations) and effects of the sampling strategy (e.g.
    sequence of stations). The numerical simulations were performed for
    two time periods with contrasting meteorological forcing conditions.
    Errors in abundance estimates were highest at high wind speeds and
    when the organisms showed a patchy distribution. Advective losses were
    highest for the shallowest distributed life stages (cod and sprat
    larvae). Under strong west-wind conditions, losses due to transport
    out of the surveyed area reached up to >10% after 2 days. Different
    sampling strategies had no impact on overall accuracy. Errors due to
    sampling resolution amounted to 2-26% for the standard grid of 45
    stations. The results suggest that wind forcing might serve as a first
    rough approximation for the reliability of historic abundance
    estimates.

AB: Abstract
    Pseudocalanus elongatus is a key species in the pelagic zone of the
    deep basins of the Central Baltic Sea. The copepod serves as a major
    food organism for larval as well as for adult, pelagic planktivorous
    fish. Large interannual fluctuations in the standing stock of P.
    elongatus have been attributed to significant changes in the
    hydrographic environment over the last two decades. In particular, the
    decreasing salinity in the Baltic deep basins, a result of a change in
    atmospheric forcing leading to an increase in rainfall since the 1980s
    and of a lack of pulses of saline water intrusions from the North Sea,
    was found to affect reproduction and maturation of the copepod. In
    parallel, dramatic changes in the weight-at-age of herring, one of the
    most important commercial fishes of the Baltic Sea, have been observed
    since the late 1980s. Using time-series on herring stomach contents,
    as well as length and weight, we provide evidence for a chain of
    events relating variability in climate, salinity and P. elongatus
    abundance to changes in diet and condition of herring in the Central
    Baltic Sea.

AB: Abstract
    A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model has been used to analyse
    temporally and spatially resolved circulation patterns in the Baltic
    Sea with special emphasis on drifting particles representing larval
    fish. The main purpose of this study was (i) to investigate potential
    drift patterns of larval fish, (ii) to identify its intra- and
    inter-annual variability for time periods based on the timing of
    spawning and (iii) to analyse its seasonal and spatial variability in
    dependence of the atmospheric forcing conditions. For the time period
    1979-1998 temporally and spatially resolved simulated flow fields were
    used to describe the potential drift from the centre of main
    reproductive effort of Baltic cod (Gadus morhua). The results of the
    model runs demonstrate a general change in circulation pattern from
    retention during a first decade (1979-1988) to dispersion in the
    following decade (1989-1998). This increase in dispersion was related
    to an increase in the variability of the local wind forcing conditions
    over the Baltic. The more frequent occurrence of dispersion in spring
    of the recent decade was accompanied by a strong decay in biomass of
    one of the main larval fish feeding component in the central basin,
    the calanoid copepod Pseudocalanus elongatus. Larger dispersion of
    this prey organism may have affected the spatial overlap and thus the
    contact rates between predator and prey. Hence, this may have resulted
    in a food limitation for early life stages of Baltic cod and
    potentially contributed to the pronounced shift in cod peak spawning
    time from spring to late summer. Early life stages of cod originating
    from late spawning fish, benefited from a stronger dispersion in late
    summer and autumn, into shallow coastal areas with higher calanoid
    abundance.

AB: Abstract
    During peak spawning of sprat Sprattus sprattus in the Baltic Sea in
    May-June egg specific gravity averaged plus or minus s.d. 1 times
    00858 plus or minus 0 times 00116 g cm super(-3) but was significantly
    higher in the beginning and significantly lower towards the end of the
    spawning season. A close relationship was found between egg diameter
    and egg specific gravity (r super(2) = 0 times 71). This relationship,
    however, changed during the spawning season indicating that some other
    factor was involved causing the decrease in specific gravity during
    the spawning period. The vertical egg distribution changed during the
    spawning season: eggs were distributed mainly in the deep layers early
    in the season, occurred in and above the permanent halocline during
    peak spawning, and above the halocline towards the end of the spawning
    season. Consequently, poor oxygen conditions in the deep layers and
    low temperatures in layers between the halocline and the developing
    thermocline may affect egg development. Thus, opportunities for egg
    development vary over the spawning season and among spawning areas,
    and depending on frequency of saline water inflows into the Baltic Sea
    and severity of winters, between years.
