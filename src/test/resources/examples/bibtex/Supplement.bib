	abstract = {With the increasing amount of available genome sequences, novel tools are needed for comprehensive analysis of species-specific sequence characteristics for a wide variety of genomes. We used an unsupervised neural network algorithm, a self-organizing map (SOM), to analyze di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide frequencies in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. The SOM, which can cluster complex data efficiently, was shown to be an excellent tool for analyzing global characteristics of genome sequences and for revealing key combinations of oligonucleotides representing individual genomes. From analysis of 1- and 10-kb genomic sequences derived from 65 bacteria (a total of 170 Mb) and from 6 eukaryotes (460 Mb), clear species-specific separations of major portions of the sequences were obtained with the di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide SOMs. The unsupervised algorithm could recognize, in most 10-kb sequences, the species-specific characteristics (key combinations of oligonucleotide frequencies) that are signature features of each genome. We were able to classify DNA sequences within one and between many species into subgroups that corresponded generally to biological categories. Because the classification power is very high, the SOM is an efficient and fundamental bioinformatic strategy for extracting a wide range of genomic information from a vast amount of sequences.}

	abstract = {Novel tools are needed for comprehensive comparisons of interspecies characteristics of massive amounts of genomic sequences currently available. An unsupervised neural network algorithm, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), is an effective tool for clustering and visualizing high-dimensional complex data on a single map. We modified the conventional SOM, on the basis of batch-learning SOM, for genome informatics making the learning process and resulting map independent of the order of data input. We generated the SOMs for tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies in 10- and 100-kb sequence fragments from 38 eukaryotes for which almost complete genome sequences are available. SOM recognized species-specific characteristics (key combinations of oligonucleotide frequencies) in the genomic sequences, permitting species-specific classification of the sequences without any information regarding the species. We also generated the SOM for tetranucleotide frequencies in 1-kb sequence fragments from the human genome and found sequences for four functional categories (5' and 3' UTRs, CDSs and introns) were classified primarily according to the categories. Because the classification and visualization power is very high, SOM is an efficient and powerful tool for extracting a wide range of genome information.}

	abstract = {The level of sequence heterogeneity among rrn operons within genomes determines the accuracy of diversity estimation by 16S rRNA-based methods. Furthermore, the occurrence of widespread horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between distantly related rrn operons casts doubt on reconstructions of phylogenetic relationships. For this study, patterns of distribution of rrn copy numbers, interoperonic divergence, and redundancy of 16S rRNA sequences were evaluated. Bacterial genomes display up to 15 operons and operon numbers up to 7 are commonly found, but approximately 40\% of the organisms analyzed have either one or two operons. Among the Archaea, a single operon appears to dominate and the highest number of operons is five. About 40\% of sequences among 380 operons in 76 bacterial genomes with multiple operons were identical to at least one other 16S rRNA sequence in the same genome, and in 38\% of the genomes all 16S rRNAs were invariant. For Archaea, the number of identical operons was only 25\%, but only five genomes with 21 operons are currently available. These considerations suggest an upper bound of roughly threefold overestimation of bacterial diversity resulting from cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from the environment; however, the inclusion of genomes with a single rrn operon may lower this correction factor to approximately 2.5. Divergence among operons appears to be small overall for both Bacteria and Archaea, with the vast majority of 16S rRNA sequences showing <1\% nucleotide differences. Only five genomes with operons with a higher level of nucleotide divergence were detected, and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis exhibited the highest level of divergence (11.6\%) noted to date. Overall, four of the five extreme cases of operon differences occurred among thermophilic bacteria, suggesting a much higher incidence of HGT in these bacteria than in other groups.}

	abstract = {Although molecular data have revealed the vast scope of microbial diversity, two fundamental questions remain unanswered even for well-defined natural microbial communities: how many bacterial types co-exist, and are such types naturally organized into phylogenetically discrete units of potential ecological significance? It has been argued that without such information, the environmental function, population biology and biogeography of microorganisms cannot be rigorously explored. Here we address these questions by comprehensive sampling of two large 16S ribosomal RNA clone libraries from a coastal bacterioplankton community. We show that compensation for artefacts generated by common library construction techniques reveals fine-scale patterns of community composition. At least 516 ribotypes (unique rRNA sequences) were detected in the sample and, by statistical extrapolation, at least 1,633 co-existing ribotypes in the sampled population. More than 50\% of the ribotypes fall into discrete clusters containing less than 1\% sequence divergence. This pattern cannot be accounted for by interoperon variation, indicating a large predominance of closely related taxa in this community. We propose that such microdiverse clusters arise by selective sweeps and persist because competitive mechanisms are too weak to purge diversity from within them.}

Other artifacts (chimeras and heteroduplex molecules) were significantly reduced by employing modified amplification protocols. Surprisingly, no skew in sequence types was detected in the two libraries constructed from PCR products amplified for different numbers of cycles. Recommendations for modification of amplification protocols and for reporting diversity estimates at 99\% sequence similarity as a standard are given.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The recent metagenome analysis has been producing a large number of host-unassigned viruses. Although assigning viruses to their hosts is basically important not only for virology but also for prevention of epidemic, it has been a laborious and difficult task to date. The only effective method for this purpose has been to find them in a same microscopic view. Now, we tried a computational approach based on genome sequences of bacteria and phages, introducing a physicochemical parameter, SOSS (Set of Oligostickiness Similarity Score) derived from oligostickiness, a measure of binding affinity of oligonucleotides to template DNA. RESULTS: We could confirm host-parasite relationships of bacteria and their phages by SOSS analysis: all phages tested (25 species) had a remarkably higher SOSS value with its host than with unrelated bacteria. Interestingly, according to SOSS values, lysogenic phages such as lambda phage (host: E. coli) or SPP1 (host: B. subtilis) have distinctively higher similarity with its host than its non-lysogenic (excretive or virulent) ones such as fd and T4 (host; E. coli) or phages gamma and PZA (host; B. subtilis). This finding is very promising for assigning host-unknown viruses to its host. We also investigated the relationship in codon usage frequency or G+C content of genomes to interpret the phenomenon revealed by SOSS analysis, obtaining evidences which support the hypothesis that higher SOSS values resulted from the cohabitation in the same environment which may cause the common biased mutation. Thus, lysogenic phages which stay inside longer resemble the host. CONTACT: koichi\@fms.saitama-u.ac.jp.}

Genome sequences from environmental samples capture the aggregate characteristics of the strain population from which they were derived. Comparison of the sequence data within and among natural populations can reveal the evolutionary processes that lead to genome diversification and speciation. Community genomic datasets can also enable subsequent gene expression and proteomic studies to determine how resources are invested and functions are distributed among community members. Ultimately, genomics can reveal how individual species and strains contribute to the net activity of the community.}

	abstract = {Genome organization can be studied through analysis of chromosome position-dependent patterns in sequence-derived parameters. A comprehensive analysis of such patterns in prokaryotic sequences and genome-scale functional data has yet to be performed. We detected spatial patterns in sequence-derived parameters for 163 chromosomes occurring in 135 bacterial and 16 archaeal organisms using wavelet analysis. Pattern strength was found to correlate with organism-specific features such as genome size, overall GC content, and the occurrence of known motility and chromosomal binding proteins. Given additional functional data for Escherichia coli, we found significant correlations among chromosome position dependent patterns in numerous properties, some of which are consistent with previously experimentally identified chromosome macrodomains. These results demonstrate that the large-scale organization of most sequenced genomes is significantly nonrandom, and, moreover, that this organization is likely linked to genome size, nucleotide composition, and information transfer processes. Constraints on genome evolution and design are thus not solely dependent upon information content, but also upon an intricate multi-parameter, multi-length-scale organization of the chromosome.}

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences.

	abstract = {The frequent discrepancy between direct microscopic counts and numbers of culturable bacteria from environmental samples is just one of several indications that we currently know only a minor part of the diversity of microorganisms in nature. A combination of direct retrieval of rRNA sequences and whole-cell oligonucleotide probing can be used to detect specific rRNA sequences of uncultured bacteria in natural samples and to microscopically identify individual cells. Studies have been performed with microbial assemblages of various complexities ranging from simple two-component bacterial endosymbiotic associations to multispecies enrichments containing magnetotactic bacteria to highly complex marine and soil communities. Phylogenetic analysis of the retrieved rRNA sequence of an uncultured microorganism reveals its closest culturable relatives and may, together with information on the physicochemical conditions of its natural habitat, facilitate more directed cultivation attempts. For the analysis of complex communities such as multispecies biofilms and activated-sludge flocs, a different approach has proven advantageous. Sets of probes specific to different taxonomic levels are applied consecutively beginning with the more general and ending with the more specific (a hierarchical top-to-bottom approach), thereby generating increasingly precise information on the structure of the community. Not only do rRNA-targeted whole-cell hybridizations yield data on cell morphology, specific cell counts, and in situ distributions of defined phylogenetic groups, but also the strength of the hybridization signal reflects the cellular rRNA content of individual cells. From the signal strength conferred by a specific probe, in situ growth rates and activities of individual cells might be estimated for known species. In many ecosystems, low cellular rRNA content and/or limited cell permeability, combined with background fluorescence, hinders in situ identification of autochthonous populations. Approaches to circumvent these problems are discussed in detail.}

	abstract = {Humans host complex microbial communities believed to contribute to health maintenance and, when in imbalance, to the development of diseases. Determining the microbial composition in patients and healthy controls may thus provide novel therapeutic targets. For this purpose, high-throughput, cost-effective methods for microbiota characterization are needed. We have employed 454-pyrosequencing of a hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene in combination with sample-specific barcode sequences which enables parallel in-depth analysis of hundreds of samples with limited sample processing. In silico modeling demonstrated that the method correctly describes microbial communities down to phylotypes below the genus level. Here we applied the technique to analyze microbial communities in throat, stomach and fecal samples. Our results demonstrate the applicability of barcoded pyrosequencing as a high-throughput method for comparative microbial ecology.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transposable elements (TE) are mobile genetic entities present in nearly all genomes. Previous work has shown that TEs tend to have a different nucleotide composition than the host genes, either considering codon usage bias or dinucleotide frequencies. We show here how these compositional differences can be used as a tool for detection and analysis of TE sequences. RESULTS: We compared the composition of TE sequences and host gene sequences using probabilistic models of nucleotide sequences. We used hidden Markov models (HMM), which take into account the base composition of the sequences (occurrences of words n nucleotides long, with n ranging here from 1 to 4) and the heterogeneity between coding and non-coding parts of sequences. We analyzed three sets of sequences containing class I TEs, class II TEs and genes respectively in three species: Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of these sets had a distinct, homogeneous composition, enabling us to distinguish between the two classes of TE and the genes. However the particular base composition of the TEs differed in the three species studied. CONCLUSIONS: This approach can be used to detect and annotate TEs in genomic sequences and complements the current homology-based TE detection methods. Furthermore, the HMM method is able to identify the parts of a sequence in which the nucleotide composition resembles that of a coding region of a TE. This is useful for the detailed annotation of TE sequences, which may contain an ancient, highly diverged coding region that is no longer fully functional.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to their bi-directional replication machinery starting from a single finite origin, bacterial genomes show characteristic nucleotide compositional bias between the two replichores, which can be visualised through GC skew or (C-G)/(C+G). Although this polarisation is used for computational prediction of replication origins in many bacterial genomes, the degree of GC skew visibility varies widely among different species, necessitating a quantitative measurement of GC skew strength in order to provide confidence measures for GC skew-based predictions of replication origins. RESULTS: Here we discuss a quantitative index for the measurement of GC skew strength, named the generalised GC skew index (gGCSI), which is applicable to genomes of any length, including bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. We demonstrate that gGCSI is independent of the window size and can thus be used to compare genomes with different sizes, such as bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. It can suggest the existence of different replication mechanisms in archaea and of rolling-circle replication in plasmids. Correlation of gGCSI values between plasmids and their corresponding host chromosomes suggests that within the same strain, these replicons have reproduced using the same replication machinery and thus exhibit similar strengths of replication strand skew. CONCLUSIONS: gGCSI can be applied to genomes of any length and thus allows comparative study of replication-related mutation and selection pressures in genomes of different lengths such as bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. Using gGCSI, we showed that replication-related mutation or selection pressure is similar for replicons with similar machinery.}

	abstract = {We introduce a model of DNA sequence evolution which can account for biases in mutation rates that depend on the identity of the neighboring bases. An analytic solution for this class of models is developed by adopting well-known methods of nonlinear dynamics. Results are presented for the CpG-methylation-deamination process, which dominates point substitutions in vertebrates. The dinucleotide frequencies generated by the model (using empirically obtained mutation rates) match the overall pattern observed in noncoding DNA. A web-based tool has been constructed to compute single- and dinucleotide frequencies for arbitrary neighbor-dependent mutation rates. Also provided is the backward procedure to infer the mutation rates using maximum likelihood analysis given the observed single- and dinucleotide frequencies. Reasonable estimates of the mutation rates can be obtained very efficiently, using generic noncoding DNA sequences as input, after masking out long homonucleotide subsequences. Our method is much more convenient and versatile to use than the traditional method of deducing mutation rates by counting mutation events in carefully chosen sequences. More generally, our approach provides a more realistic but still tractable description of noncoding genomic DNA and may be used as a null model for various sequence analysis applications.}

	abstract = {A new method for detecting chimeras and other anomalies within 16S rRNA sequence records is presented. Using this method, we screened 1,399 sequences from 19 phyla, as defined by the Ribosomal Database Project, release 9, update 22, and found 5.0\% to harbor substantial errors. Of these, 64.3\% were obvious chimeras, 14.3\% were unidentified sequencing errors, and 21.4\% were highly degenerate. In all, 11 phyla contained obvious chimeras, accounting for 0.8 to 11\% of the records for these phyla. Many chimeras (43.1\%) were formed from parental sequences belonging to different phyla. While most comprised two fragments, 13.7\% were composed of at least three fragments, often from three different sources. A separate analysis of the Bacteroidetes phylum (2,739 sequences) also revealed 5.8\% records to be anomalous, of which 65.4\% were apparently chimeric. Overall, we conclude that, as a conservative estimate, 1 in every 20 public database records is likely to be corrupt. Our results support concerns recently expressed over the quality of the public repositories. With 16S rRNA sequence data increasingly playing a dominant role in bacterial systematics and environmental biodiversity studies, it is vital that steps be taken to improve screening of sequences prior to submission. To this end, we have implemented our method as a program with a simple-to-use graphic user interface that is capable of running on a range of computer platforms.

	abstract = {The principle of heterotachy states that the substitution rate of sites in a gene can change through time. In this article, we propose a powerful statistical test to detect sites that evolve according to the process of heterotachy. We apply this test to an alignment of 1289 eukaryotic rRNA molecules to 1) determine how widespread the phenomenon of heterotachy is in ribosomal RNA, 2) to test whether these heterotachous sites are nonrandomly distributed, that is, linked to secondary structure features of ribosomal RNA, and 3) to determine the impact of heterotachous sites on the bootstrap support of monophyletic groupings. Our study revealed that with 21 monophyletic taxa, approximately two-thirds of the sites in the considered set of sequences is heterotachous. Although the detected heterotachous sites do not appear bound to specific structural features of the small subunit rRNA, their presence is shown to have a large beneficial influence on the bootstrap support of monophyletic groups. Using extensive testing, we show that this may not be due to heterotachy itself but merely due to the increased substitution rate at the detected heterotachous sites.}

To this aim, we introduce a clustering method based on information theory, specifically designed to cluster genes according to their codon usage and apply it to the coding sequences of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. One of the clusters identified in each of the organisms is found to be related to expression levels, as expected, but other groups feature an over-representation of genes belonging to different functional groups, namely horizontally transferred genes, motility, and intermediary metabolism. Furthermore, we show that genes with a similar bias tend to be close to each other on the chromosome and organized in coherent domains, more extended than operons, demonstrating a role of translation in structuring bacterial chromosomes. It is argued that a sizeable contribution to this effect comes from the dynamical compartimentalization induced by the recycling of tRNAs, leading to gene expression rates dependent on their genomic and expression context.}

This technique relies on the assumption that the gene sequences present in the environment are complementary to the "universal" primers used in their amplification. The recent discovery of new taxa with 16S rDNA sequences not complementary to standard universal primers suggests that current 16S rDNA libraries are not representative of true prokaryotic biodiversity. Here we re-assess the specificity of commonly used 16S rRNA gene primers and present these data in tabular form designed as a tool to aid simple analysis, selection and implementation. In addition, we present two new primer pairs specifically designed for effective "universal" Archaeal 16S rDNA sequence amplification. These primers are found to amplify sequences from Crenarchaeote and Euryarchaeote type strains and environmental DNA.}

An unconsidered choice of primers may therefore lead to significant bias in determination of microbial community composition. In particular, Archaea-specific primer sequences typically lack specificity for the Korarchaeota and Nanoarchaea and are often biased towards certain clades. New primer pairs specifically designed for "universal" archaeal 16 S rDNA sequence amplification, with homology to all four archaeal groups, have been designed. Here we present the application of these new primers for preparation of 16 S libraries from thermophile communities.}

	abstract = {Microbial communities host unparalleled taxonomic diversity. Adequate characterization of environmental and host-associated samples remains a challenge for microbiologists, despite the advent of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In order to increase the depth of sampling for diverse bacterial communities, we developed a method for sequencing and assembling millions of paired-end reads from the 16S rRNA gene (spanning the V3 region; ∼200 nucleotides) by using an Illumina genome analyzer. To confirm reproducibility and to identify a suitable computational pipeline for data analysis, sequence libraries were prepared in duplicate for both a defined mixture of DNAs from known cultured bacterial isolates (>1 million postassembly sequences) and an Arctic tundra soil sample (>6 million postassembly sequences). The Illumina 16S rRNA gene libraries represent a substantial increase in number of sequences over all extant next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g., 454 pyrosequencing), while the assembly of paired-end 125-base reads offers a methodological advantage by incorporating an initial quality control step for each 16S rRNA gene sequence. This method incorporates indexed primers to enable the characterization of multiple microbial communities in a single flow cell lane, may be modified readily to target other variable regions or genes, and demonstrates unprecedented and economical access to DNAs from organisms that exist at low relative abundances.}

	abstract = {Bacterial communities provide important services. They break down pollutants, municipal waste and ingested food, and they are the primary means by which organic matter is recycled to plants and other autotrophs. However, the processes that determine the rate at which these services are supplied are only starting to be identified. Biodiversity influences the way in which ecosystems function, but the form of the relationship between bacterial biodiversity and functioning remains poorly understood. Here we describe a manipulative experiment that measured how biodiversity affects the functioning of communities containing up to 72 bacterial species constructed from a collection of naturally occurring culturable bacteria. The experimental design allowed us to manipulate large numbers of bacterial species selected at random from those that were culturable. We demonstrate that there is a decelerating relationship between community respiration and increasing bacterial diversity. We also show that both synergistic interactions among bacterial species and the composition of the bacterial community are important in determining the level of ecosystem functioning.}

	abstract = {More than twice as much carbon is held in soils as in vegetation or the atmosphere, and changes in soil carbon content can have a large effect on the global carbon budget. The possibility that climate change is being reinforced by increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils owing to rising temperature is the subject of a continuing debate. But evidence for the suggested feedback mechanism has to date come solely from small-scale laboratory and field experiments and modelling studies. Here we use data from the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales obtained between 1978 and 2003 to show that carbon was lost from soils across England and Wales over the survey period at a mean rate of 0.6\% yr(-1) (relative to the existing soil carbon content). We find that the relative rate of carbon loss increased with soil carbon content and was more than 2\% yr(-1) in soils with carbon contents greater than 100 g kg(-1). The relationship between rate of carbon loss and carbon content is irrespective of land use, suggesting a link to climate change. Our findings indicate that losses of soil carbon in England and Wales--and by inference in other temperate regions-are likely to have been offsetting absorption of carbon by terrestrial sinks.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Despite advances in high-throughput methods for discovering protein-protein interactions, the interaction networks of even well-studied model organisms are sketchy at best, highlighting the continued need for computational methods to help direct experimentalists in the search for novel interactions. RESULTS: We present a kernel method for predicting protein-protein interactions using a combination of data sources, including protein sequences, Gene Ontology annotations, local properties of the network, and homologous interactions in other species. Whereas protein kernels proposed in the literature provide a similarity between single proteins, prediction of interactions requires a kernel between pairs of proteins. We propose a pairwise kernel that converts a kernel between single proteins into a kernel between pairs of proteins, and we illustrate the kernel's effectiveness in conjunction with a support vector machine classifier. Furthermore, we obtain improved performance by combining several sequence-based kernels based on k-mer frequency, motif and domain content and by further augmenting the pairwise sequence kernel with features that are based on other sources of data.We apply our method to predict physical interactions in yeast using data from the BIND database. At a false positive rate of 1\% the classifier retrieves close to 80\% of a set of trusted interactions. We thus demonstrate the ability of our method to make accurate predictions despite the sizeable fraction of false positives that are known to exist in interaction databases. AVAILABILITY: The classification experiments were performed using PyML available at http://pyml.sourceforge.net.

The pcb genes, encoding the major chlorophyll-binding, light-harvesting antenna proteins in this genus, are present in multiple copies in low-light strains but as a single copy in high-light strains. The basis of this differentiation, however, has remained obscure. Here we show that the moderate low-light-adapted strain Prochlorococcus sp. MIT 9313 has one iron-stress-induced pcb gene encoding an antenna protein serving photosystem I (PSI)--comparable to isiA genes from cyanobacteria--and a constitutively expressed pcb gene encoding a photosystem II (PSII) antenna protein. By comparison, the very low-light-adapted strain SS120 has seven pcb genes encoding constitutive PSI and PSII antennae, plus one PSI iron-regulated pcb gene, whereas the high-light-adapted strain MED4 has only a constitutive PSII antenna. Thus, it seems that the adaptation of Prochlorococcus to low light environments has triggered a multiplication and specialization of Pcb proteins comparable to that found for Cab proteins in plants and green algae.}

Here we describe the habitat-based microbial diversity, both taxon evenness and taxon richness, for each GOS site and estimate genome characteristics of a typical free-living, surface ocean water bacterium. While Alphaproteobacteria and particularly SAR11 dominate the 0.1- to 0.8-mum size fraction of surface ocean water bacteria (43\% and 31\%, respectively), the proportions of other taxa varied with ocean habitat type. Within each habitat type, lower-bound estimates of phylum richness ranged between 18 and 59 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). However, OTU richness was relatively low in the hypersaline lagoon community at every taxonomic level, and open-ocean communities had much more microdiversity than any other habitat. Based on the abundance of single-copy eubacterial genes from the same data set, we estimate that the genome of an average free-living surface ocean water bacterium (sized between 0.1 and 0.8 mum) contains approximately 1,019 genes and 1.8 copies of the 16S rRNA gene, suggesting that these bacteria have relatively streamlined genomes in comparison to those of cultured bacteria and bacteria from other habitats (e.g., soil or acid mine drainage).}

The use of group-specific primers in community DNA profiling applications can provide enhanced sensitivity and phylogenetic detail compared to domain-specific primers. Other uses for group-specific primers include quantitative PCR and library screening. The purpose of the present study was to develop several primer sets targeting commonly occurring and important groups. Primers specific for the 16S ribosomal sequences of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes and for parts of both the 18S ribosomal sequence and the internal transcribed spacer region of Basidiomycota were examined. Primers were tested by comparison to sequences in the ARB 2003 database, and chosen primers were further tested by cloning and sequencing from soil community DNA. Eighty-five to 100\% of the sequences obtained from clone libraries were found to be placed with the groups intended as targets, demonstrating the specificity of the primers under field conditions. It will be important to reevaluate primers over time because of the continual growth of sequence databases and revision of microbial taxonomy.}

Here we describe a compact Web application, Galaxy2(ENCODE), that effectively addresses these issues. It provides an intuitive interface for the deposition and access of data, and features a vast number of analysis tools including operations on genomic intervals, utilities for manipulation of multiple sequence alignments, and molecular evolution algorithms. By providing a direct link between data and analysis tools, Galaxy2(ENCODE) allows addressing biological questions that are beyond the reach of existing software. We use Galaxy2(ENCODE) to show that the ENCODE regions contain >2000 unannotated transcripts under strong purifying selection that are likely functional. We also show that the ENCODE regions are representative of the entire genome by estimating the rate of nucleotide substitution and comparing it to published data. Although each of these analyses is complex, none takes more than 15 min from beginning to end. Finally, we demonstrate how new tools can be added to Galaxy2(ENCODE) with almost no effort. Every section of the manuscript is supplemented with QuickTime screencasts. Galaxy2(ENCODE) and the screencasts can be accessed at http://g2.bx.psu.edu.}

	abstract = {High-throughput data production has revolutionized molecular biology. However, massive increases in data generation capacity require analysis approaches that are more sophisticated, and often very computationally intensive. Thus, making sense of high-throughput data requires informatics support. Galaxy (http://galaxyproject.org) is a software system that provides this support through a framework that gives experimentalists simple interfaces to powerful tools, while automatically managing the computational details. Galaxy is distributed both as a publicly available Web service, which provides tools for the analysis of genomic, comparative genomic, and functional genomic data, or a downloadable package that can be deployed in individual laboratories. Either way, it allows experimentalists without informatics or programming expertise to perform complex large-scale analysis with just a Web browser.}

As a result, progress in genome research is increasingly impeded by bioinformatic hurdles. A new generation of powerful and easy-to-use genome analysis tools has been developed to address this issue, enabling biologists to perform complex bioinformatic analyses online - without having to learn a programming language or downloading and manually processing large datasets. In this tutorial paper, we describe the use of EpiGRAPH (http://epigraph.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and Galaxy (http://galaxyproject.org/) for genome and epigenome analysis, and we illustrate how these two web services work together to identify epigenetic modifications that are characteristics of highly polymorphic (SNP-rich) promoters. This paper is supplemented with video tutorials (http://tinyurl.com/yc5xkqq), which provide a step-by-step guide through each example analysis.},

	abstract = {Oligonucleotide usage in archaeal and bacterial genomes can be linked to a number of properties, including codon usage (trinucleotides), DNA base-stacking energy (dinucleotides), and DNA structural conformation (di- to tetranucleotides). We wanted to assess the statistical information potential of different DNA 'word-sizes' and explore how oligonucleotide frequencies differ in coding and non-coding regions. In addition, we used oligonucleotide frequencies to investigate DNA composition and how DNA sequence patterns change within and between prokaryotic organisms. Among the results found was that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short range correlated, i.e., information in prokaryotic genomes is encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. Bias (selectional pressure) in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were also found to be approximately 5.5\% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes. GC-rich genomes were more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes. The differences found between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may possibly be attributed to lifestyle, since tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was, on average, more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria.}

One main challenge facing metagenomic analysis is phylogenetic classification of raw sequence reads into groups representing the same or similar taxa, a prerequisite for genome assembly and for analyzing the biological diversity of a sample. New sequencing technologies have made metagenomics easier, by making sequencing faster, and more difficult, by producing shorter reads than previous technologies. Classifying sequences from reads as short as 100 base pairs has until now been relatively inaccurate, requiring researchers to use older, long-read technologies. We present Phymm, a classifier for metagenomic data, that has been trained on 539 complete, curated genomes and can accurately classify reads as short as 100 base pairs, a substantial improvement over previous composition-based classification methods. We also describe how combining Phymm with sequence alignment algorithms improves accuracy.}

	abstract = {Microbial communities were characterized during biodegradation of immobilized oil in seawater from the Statfjord field and the German Bight in the North Sea. Seawater samples were collected at different distances from pollution sources at the two locations. A Statfjord oil was immobilized on hydrophobic synthetic Fluortex fabrics and submerged in closed flasks (no headspace) with natural or sterile seawater and incubated at 13 degrees C for 56 days. Biodegradation of immobilized n-alkanes was measured by gas chromatography, total microbes were enumerated by epifluorescence microscopy, and culturable heterotrophic and oil-degrading microorganisms were quantified by most probable number (MPN) analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA in water samples was conducted during biodegradation experiments. The amplified 16S rDNA fragments were characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and by sequence analysis of cloned inserts. Biodegradation rates of alkanes in seawater collected at different distances from the pollution sources did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). Concentrations of oil-degrading microorganisms showed a temporary peak after 7 days of degradation, with a subsequent decline later in the period. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA genes showed that community diversity decreased during the first 2-3 weeks of biodegradation, with the emergence of a few dominant bands. Cloning, restriction analysis, and sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA fragments revealed >30 different phylotypes. Abundant types during biodegradation belonged to the alpha-Proteobacteria, in waters from both Statfjord and the German Bight. Cloning and sequencing studies indicated that the most abundant bacteria during biodegradation belonged to the family Rhodobacteraceae, with the closest relationship to the genera Sulfitobacter and Roseobacter.}

Here we report a genomic analysis of two uncultured marine viral communities. Over 65\% of the sequences were not significantly similar to previously reported sequences, suggesting that much of the diversity is previously uncharacterized. The most common significant hits among the known sequences were to viruses. The viral hits included sequences from all of the major families of dsDNA tailed phages, as well as some algal viruses. Several independent mathematical models based on the observed number of contigs predicted that the most abundant viral genome comprised 2-3\% of the total population in both communities, which was estimated to contain between 374 and 7,114 viral types. Overall, diversity of the viral communities was extremely high. The results also showed that it would be possible to sequence the entire genome of an uncultured marine viral community.}

We present the metagenomic analysis of an uncultured near-shore marine-sediment viral community. Three-quarters of the sequences in the sample were not related to anything previously reported. Among the sequences that could be identified, the majority belonged to double-stranded DNA phage. Temperate phage were more common than lytic phage, suggesting that lysogeny may be an important lifestyle for sediment viruses. Comparisons between the sediment sample and previously sequenced seawater viral communities showed that certain phage phylogenetic groups were abundant in all marine viral communities, while other phage groups were under-represented or absent. This 'marineness' suggests that marine phage are derived from a common set of ancestors. Several independent mathematical models, based on the distribution of overlapping shotgun sequence fragments from the library, were used to show that the diversity of the viral community was extremely high, with at least 10(4) viral genotypes per kilogram of sediment and a Shannon index greater than 9 nats. Based on these observations we propose that marine-sediment viral communities are one of the largest unexplored reservoirs of sequence space on the planet.}

To address this question, we used the polymerase chain reaction to construct and analyze a library of 51 small-subunit (16S) rRNA genes cloned from Sargasso Sea bacterioplankton genomic DNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to conserved regions in the 16S rDNAs of eubacteria were used to direct the synthesis of polymerase chain reaction products, which were then cloned by blunt-end ligation into the phagemid vector pBluescript. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms and hybridizations to oligonucleotide probes for the SAR11 and marine Synechococcus phylogenetic groups indicated the presence of at least seven classes of genes. The sequences of five unique rDNAs were determined completely. In addition to 16S rRNA genes from the marine Synechococcus cluster and the previously identified but uncultivated microbial group, the SAR11 cluster [S. J. Giovannoni, T. B. Britschgi, C. L. Moyer, and K. G. Field. Nature (London) 345:60-63], two new gene classes were observed. Phylogenetic comparisons indicated that these belonged to unknown species of alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria.

Significant challenges remain in genome annotation methods, including the identification of small or overlapping genes and the assessment of mRNA splicing or unconventional translation signals in expression. We have employed a combined analysis of compositional biases and conservation together with frame-specific G+C representation to reevaluate and annotate the genome sequences of mouse and rat cytomegaloviruses. Our analysis predicts that there are at least 34 protein-coding regions in these genomes that were not apparent in earlier annotation efforts. These include 17 single-exon genes, three new exons of previously identified genes, a newly identified four-exon gene for a lectin-like protein (in rat cytomegalovirus), and 10 probable frameshift extensions of previously annotated genes. This expanded set of candidate genes provides an additional basis for investigation in cytomegalovirus biology and pathogenesis.}

	abstract = {Our basic observation is that each genome has a characteristic "signature" defined as the ratios between the observed dinucleotide frequencies and the frequencies expected if neighbors were chosen at random (dinucleotide relative abundances). The remarkable fact is that the signature is relatively constant throughout the genome; i.e. , the patterns and levels of dinucleotide relative abundances of every 50-kb segment of the genome are about the same. Comparison of the signatures of different genomes provides a measure of similarity which has the advantage that it looks at all the DNA of an organism and does not depend on the ability to align homologous sequences of specific genes. Genome signature comparisons show that plasmids, both specialized and broad-range, and their hosts have substantially compatible (similar) genome signatures. Mammalian mitochondrial (Mt) genomes are very similar, and animal and fungal Mt are generally moderately similar, but they diverge significantly from plant and protist Mt sets. Moreover, Mt genome signature differences between species parallel the corresponding nuclear genome signature differences, despite large differences between Mt and host nuclear signatures. In signature terms, we find that the archaea are not a coherent clade. For example, Sulfolobus and Halobacterium are extremely divergent. There is no consistent pattern of signature differences among thermophiles. More generally, grouping prokaryotes by environmental criteria (e.g., habitat propensities, osmolarity tolerance, chemical conditions) reveals no correlations in genome signature.}

UFM is based on the scoring of purine bias (Rrr) and stop codon frequency. We show that the success rate of CDS/intron classification by UFM is higher than by CSF. UFM classifies ORFs as coding or non-coding through a score based on (i) the stop codon distribution, (ii) the product of purine probabilities in the three positions of nucleotide triplets, (iii) the product of Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Adenine (A) probabilities in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions of triplets, respectively, (iv) the probabilities of G in 1st and 2nd position of triplets and (v) the distance of their GC3 vs. GC2 levels to the regression line of the universal correlation. More than 80\% of CDSs (true positives) of Homo sapiens (>250 bp), Drosophila melanogaster (>250 bp) and Arabidopsis thaliana (>200 bp) are successfully classified with a false positive rate lower or equal to 5\%. The method releases coding sequences in their coding strand and coding frame, which allows their automatic translation into protein sequences with 95\% confidence. The method is a natural consequence of the compositional bias of nucleotides in coding sequences.}

	abstract = {Microbes are the most abundant and diverse organisms on Earth. In contrast to macroscopic organisms, their environmental preferences and ecological interdependencies remain difficult to assess, requiring laborious molecular surveys at diverse sampling sites. Here we present a global meta-analysis of previously sampled microbial lineages in the environment. We grouped publicly available 16S ribosomal RNA sequences into operational taxonomic units at various levels of resolution, and systematically searched these for co-occurrence across environments. Naturally occurring microbes indeed exhibited numerous, significant inter-lineage associations. These ranged from relatively specific groupings encompassing only a few lineages, to larger assemblages of microbes with shared habitat preferences. Many of the co-existing lineages were phylogenetically closely related, but a significant number of distant associations were observed as well. The increased availability of completely sequenced genomes allowed us, for the first time, to search for genomic correlates of such ecological associations. Genomes from coexisting microbes tended to be more similar than expected by chance, both with respect to pathway content and genome size, and outliers from these trends are discussed. We hypothesize that groupings of lineages are often ancient, and that they may have significantly impacted on genome evolution.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In metagenomic studies, a process called binning is necessary to assign contigs that belong to multiple species to their respective phylogenetic groups. Most of the current methods of binning, such as BLAST, k-mer and PhyloPythia, involve assigning sequence fragments by comparing sequence similarity or sequence composition with already-sequenced genomes that are still far from comprehensive. We propose a semi-supervised seeding method for binning that does not depend on knowledge of completed genomes. Instead, it extracts the flanking sequences of highly conserved 16S rRNA from the metagenome and uses them as seeds (labels) to assign other reads based on their compositional similarity. RESULTS: The proposed seeding method is implemented on an unsupervised Growing Self-Organising Map (GSOM), and called Seeded GSOM (S-GSOM). We compared it with four well-known semi-supervised learning methods in a preliminary test, separating random-length prokaryotic sequence fragments sampled from the NCBI genome database. We identified the flanking sequences of the highly conserved 16S rRNA as suitable seeds that could be used to group the sequence fragments according to their species. S-GSOM showed superior performance compared to the semi-supervised methods tested. Additionally, S-GSOM may also be used to visually identify some species that do not have seeds. The proposed method was then applied to simulated metagenomic datasets using two different confidence threshold settings and compared with PhyloPythia, k-mer and BLAST. At the reference taxonomic level Order, S-GSOM outperformed all k-mer and BLAST results and showed comparable results with PhyloPythia for each of the corresponding confidence settings, where S-GSOM performed better than PhyloPythia in the >=10 reads datasets and comparable in the >=8 kb benchmark tests. CONCLUSIONS: In the task of binning using semi-supervised learning methods, results indicate S-GSOM to be the best of the methods tested. Most importantly, the proposed method does not require knowledge from known genomes and uses only very few labels (one per species is sufficient in most cases), which are extracted from the metagenome itself. These advantages make it a very attractive binning method. S-GSOM outperformed the binning methods that depend on already-sequenced genomes, and compares well to the current most advanced binning method, PhyloPythia.}

The step of clustering these sequences, based on biological and molecular features, is called binning. A reported strategy for binning that combines oligonucleotide frequency and self-organising maps (SOM) shows high potential. We improve this strategy by identifying suitable training features, implementing a better clustering algorithm, and defining quantitative measures for assessing results. We investigated the suitability of each of di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotide frequencies. The results show that dinucleotide frequency is not a sufficiently strong signature for binning 10 kb long DNA sequences, compared to the other three. Furthermore, we observed that increased order of oligonucleotide frequency may deteriorate the assignment result in some cases, which indicates the possible existence of optimal species-specific oligonucleotide frequency. We replaced SOM with growing self-organising map (GSOM) where comparable results are obtained while gaining 7\%-15\% speed improvement.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular phylogenetic methods are based on alignments of nucleic or peptidic sequences. The tremendous increase in molecular data permits phylogenetic analyses of very long sequences and of many species, but also requires methods to help manage large datasets. RESULTS: Here we explore the phylogenetic signal present in molecular data by genomic signatures, defined as the set of frequencies of short oligonucleotides present in DNA sequences. Although violating many of the standard assumptions of traditional phylogenetic analyses--in particular explicit statements of homology inherent in character matrices--the use of the signature does permit the analysis of very long sequences, even those that are unalignable, and is therefore most useful in cases where alignment is questionable. We compare the results obtained by traditional phylogenetic methods to those inferred by the signature method for two genes: RAG1, which is easily alignable, and 18S RNA, where alignments are often ambiguous for some regions. We also apply this method to a multigene data set of 33 genes for 9 bacteria and one archea species as well as to the whole genome of a set of 16 gamma-proteobacteria. In addition to delivering phylogenetic results comparable to traditional methods, the comparison of signatures for the sequences involved in the bacterial example identified putative candidates for horizontal gene transfers. CONCLUSION: The signature method is therefore a fast tool for exploring phylogenetic data, providing not only a pretreatment for discovering new sequence relationships, but also for identifying cases of sequence evolution that could confound traditional phylogenetic analysis.}

	abstract = {The application of whole-genome shotgun sequencing to microbial communities represents a major development in metagenomics, the study of uncultured microbes via the tools of modern genomic analysis. In the past year, whole-genome shotgun sequencing projects of prokaryotic communities from an acid mine biofilm, the Sargasso Sea, Minnesota farm soil, three deep-sea whale falls, and deep-sea sediments have been reported, adding to previously published work on viral communities from marine and fecal samples. The interpretation of this new kind of data poses a wide variety of exciting and difficult bioinformatics problems. The aim of this review is to introduce the bioinformatics community to this emerging field by surveying existing techniques and promising new approaches for several of the most interesting of these computational problems.}

	abstract = {Analysis of genome-wide codon bias shows that only two parameters effectively differentiate the genome-wide codon bias of 100 eubacterial and archaeal organisms. The first parameter correlates with genome GC content, and the second parameter correlates with context-dependent nucleotide bias. Both of these parameters may be calculated from intergenic sequences. Therefore, genome-wide codon bias in eubacteria and archaea may be predicted from intergenic sequences that are not translated. When these two parameters are calculated for genes from nonmammalian eukaryotic organisms, genes from the same organism again have similar values, and genome-wide codon bias may also be predicted from intergenic sequences. In mammals, genes from the same organism are similar only in the second parameter, because GC content varies widely among isochores. Our results suggest that, in general, genome-wide codon bias is determined primarily by mutational processes that act throughout the genome, and only secondarily by selective forces acting on translated sequences.}

	abstract = {A culture-independent molecular phylogenetic approach was used to study prokaryotic diversity in an anaerobic sludge digester. Two 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed using total genomic DNA, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for archaeal or bacterial domains. Phylogenetic analysis of 246 and 579 almost full-length 16S rRNA genes for Archaea and Bacteria, respectively, was performed using the ARB software package. Phylogenetic groups affiliated with the Archaea belong to Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Interestingly, we detected a novel monophyletic group of 164 clones representing 66.6\% of the archaeal library. Culture enrichment and probe hybridization show that this group grows better under formate or H2-CO2. Within the bacterial library 95.6\% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) represent novel putative phylotypes never described before, and affiliated with eight divisions. The Bacteroidetes phylum is the most abundant and diversified phylogenetic group representing 38.8\% of the OTUs, followed by the gram-positives (27.7\%) and the Proteobacteria (21.3\%). Sequences affiliated with phylogenetic divisions represented by few cultivated representatives such as the Chloroflexi, Synergistes, Thermotogales or candidate divisions such as OP9 and OP8 are represented by <5\% of the total OTUs. A comprehensive set of 15 16S and 23S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide hybridization probes was used to quantify these major groups by dot blot hybridization within 12 digester samples. In contrast to the clone library, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria together accounted for 21.8 +/- 14.9\% representing the most abundant phyla. They were surprisingly followed by the Chloroflexi representing 20.2 +/- 4.6\% of the total 16S rRNA. The Proteobacteria and the Bacteroidetes group accounted for 14.4 +/- 4.9\% and 14.5 +/- 4.3\%, respectively, WWE1, a novel lineage, accounted for 11.9 +/- 3.1\% while Planctomycetes and Synergistes represented <2\% each. Using the novel set of probes we extended the coverage of bacterial populations from 52\% to 85.3\% of the total rRNA within the digester samples.}

	abstract = {Biological ice nucleators (IN) function as catalysts for freezing at relatively warm temperatures (warmer than -10 degrees C). We examined the concentration (per volume of liquid) and nature of IN in precipitation collected from Montana and Louisiana, the Alps and Pyrenees (France), Ross Island (Antarctica), and Yukon (Canada). The temperature of detectable ice-nucleating activity for more than half of the samples was > or = -5 degrees C based on immersion freezing testing. Digestion of the samples with lysozyme (i.e., to hydrolyze bacterial cell walls) led to reductions in the frequency of freezing (0-100\%); heat treatment greatly reduced (95\% average) or completely eliminated ice nucleation at the measured conditions in every sample. These behaviors were consistent with the activity being bacterial and/or proteinaceous in origin. Statistical analysis revealed seasonal similarities between warm-temperature ice-nucleating activities in snow samples collected over 7 months in Montana. Multiple regression was used to construct models with biogeochemical data [major ions, total organic carbon (TOC), particle, and cell concentration] that were accurate in predicting the concentration of microbial cells and biological IN in precipitation based on the concentration of TOC, Ca(2+), and NH(4)(+), or TOC, cells, Ca(2+), NH(4)(+), K(+), PO(4)(3-), SO(4)(2-), Cl(-), and HCO(3)(-). Our results indicate that biological IN are ubiquitous in precipitation and that for some geographic locations the activity and concentration of these particles is related to the season and precipitation chemistry. Thus, our research suggests that biological IN are widespread in the atmosphere and may affect meteorological processes that lead to precipitation.}

	abstract = {Summary The severe environmental stresses of the Arctic may have promoted unique soil bacterial communities compared with those found in lower latitude environments. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the biogeography of soil bacterial communities in the Arctic using a high resolution bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. We also compared arctic soils with soils from a wide range of more temperate biomes to characterize variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe. We show that arctic soil bacterial community composition and diversity are structured according to local variation in soil pH rather than geographical proximity to neighboring sites, suggesting that local environmental heterogeneity is far more important than dispersal limitation in determining community-level differences. Furthermore, bacterial community composition had similar levels of variability, richness and phylogenetic diversity within arctic soils as across soils from a wide range of lower latitudes, strongly suggesting a common diversity structure within soil bacterial communities around the globe. These results contrast with the well-established latitudinal gradients in animal and plant diversity, suggesting that the controls on bacterial community distributions are fundamentally different from those observed for macro-organisms and that our biome definitions are not useful for predicting variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe.}

We tested this method with seven rRNA (including 12S, 16S, 18S, 26S and 28S) datasets from a wide variety of organisms (from archaea to tetrapods) at taxonomic levels ranging from class to species. RESULT: Our results indicate that grouping of taxa based on composition vector analysis is always in good agreement with the phylogenetic trees generated by traditional approaches, although in some cases the relationships among the higher systemic groups may differ. The effectiveness of our analysis might be related to the length and divergence among sequences in a dataset. Nevertheless, the correct grouping of sequences and accurate assignment of unknown taxa make our analysis a reliable and convenient approach in analyzing unaligned sequence datasets of various rRNAs for barcoding purposes. AVAILABILITY: The newly designed software (CVTree 1.0) is publicly available at the Composition Vector Tree (CVTree) web server http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn.}

Systematic detection and subsequent exclusion of products of horizontal gene transfer increased phylogenetic resolution, allowing us to confirm accepted relationships and resolve disputed and preliminary classifications.

These sequences have been analyzed by neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and parsimony. The robustness of each topology was assessed by bootstrap. Sequences were obtained for the seven rrn operons of E. coli strain PK3. These data demonstrated differences located in three highly variable domains. Their nature and localization suggest that since the divergence of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, most point mutations that occurred within each gene have been propagated among the gene family by conversions involving short domains, and that homogenization by conversions may not have affected the entire sequence of each gene. We show that the differences that exist between the different operons are ignored when sequences are obtained either after cloning of a single operon or directly from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Direct sequencing of PCR products produces a mean sequence in which mutations present in the most variable domains become hidden. Cloning a single operon results in a sequence that differs from that of the other operons and of the mean sequence by several point mutations. For identification of unknown bacteria at the species level or below, a mean sequence or the sequence of a single nonidentified operon should therefore be avoided. Taking into account the seven operons and therefore mutations that accumulate in the most variable domains would perhaps increase tree resolution. However, if gene conversions that homogenize the rRNA multigene family are rare events, some nodes in phylogenetic trees will reflect these recombination events and these trees may therefore be gene trees rather than organismal trees.}

Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies allow for even finer resolution. We compared phylogenetic profiling of both longer (454 Titanium) sequence reads with shorter, but more numerous, paired-end reads (Illumina). For both approaches, we targeted six tandem combinations of 16S rRNA gene variable regions, in microbial DNA extracted from a human faecal sample, in order to investigate their limitations and potentials. In silico evaluations predicted that the V3/V4 and V4/V5 regions would provide the highest classification accuracies for both technologies. However, experimental sequencing of the V3/V4 region revealed significant amplification bias compared to the other regions, emphasising the necessity for experimental validation of primer pairs. The latest developments of 454 and Illumina technologies offered higher resolution compared to their previous versions, and showed relative consistency with each other. However, the majority of the Illumina reads could not be classified down to genus level due to their shorter length and higher error rates beyond 60 nt. Nonetheless, with improved quality and longer reads, the far greater coverage of Illumina promises unparalleled insights into highly diverse and complex environments such as the human gut.}

	abstract = {Ambiguities in the taxonomy dependent assignment of pyrosequencing reads are usually resolved by mapping each read to the lowest common ancestor in a reference taxonomy of all those sequences that match the read. This conservative approach has the drawback of mapping a read to a possibly large clade that may also contain many sequences not matching the read. A more accurate taxonomic assignment of short reads can be made by mapping each read to the node in the reference taxonomy that provides the best precision and recall. We show that given a suffix array for the sequences in the reference taxonomy, a short read can be mapped to the node of the reference taxonomy with the best combined value of precision and recall in time linear in the size of the taxonomy subtree rooted at the lowest common ancestor of the matching sequences. An accurate taxonomic assignment of short reads can thus be made with about the same efficiency as when mapping each read to the lowest common ancestor of all matching sequences in a reference taxonomy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several metagenomic datasets of marine and gut microbiota.}

	abstract = {The availability of a large number of completely sequenced bacterial genomes allows the rapid and reliable determination of intragenomic sequence heterogeneity of 16S rRNA genes. In the present study we assessed the intragenomic sequence heterogeneity of 16S rRNA genes in 55 bacterial genomes, representing various phylogenetic groups. The total number of rRNA operons in genomes included ranged from 2 to 13. The maximum number of nucleotides that were different between any pair of 16S rRNA genes within a genome ranged from 0 to 19. The corresponding minimal similarity ranged from 100 to 98.74\%. This indicates that the intragenomic heterogeneity between multiple 16S rRNA operons in these genomes is rather limited and is unlikely to have a profound effect on the classification of taxa. Among the multiple copies of the 16S rRNA genes present in the genomes included, 199 mutations were counted with transitions being the dominant type of mutations over the total length of the 16S rRNA gene. Most heterogeneity occurred in variable regions V1, V2, and V6.}

Twenty-eight completely sequenced bacterial genomes were included in the study. The correlation between the genomic signature and DNA-DNA hybridisation values was high and taxa that showed less than 30\% DNA-DNA binding will in general not have dinucleotide relative abundance dissimilarity (delta*) values below 40. On the other hand, taxa showing more than 50\% DNA-DNA binding will not have delta* values higher than 17. Our data indicate that the overall correlation between genomic signature and 16S rDNA sequence similarity is low, except for closely related organisms (16S rDNA similarity >94\%). Statistical analysis of delta* values between different subgroups of the Proteobacteria indicate that the beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria are more closely related to each other than to the other subgroups of the Proteobacteria and that the alpha- and epsilon-Proteobacteria form clearly separate subgroups. Using the genomic signature we have also predicted DNA-DNA binding values for fastidious or unculturable endosymbionts belonging to the genera Rickettsia, Wigglesworthia and Buchnera.}

	abstract = {Bacterial systematics has not yet reached a consensus for defining the fundamental unit of biological diversity, the species. The past half-century of bacterial systematics has been characterized by improvements in methods for demarcating species as phenotypic and genetic clusters, but species demarcation has not been guided by a theory-based concept of species. Eukaryote systematists have developed a universal concept of species: A species is a group of organisms whose divergence is capped by a force of cohesion; divergence between different species is irreversible; and different species are ecologically distinct. In the case of bacteria, these universal properties are held not by the named species of systematics but by ecotypes. These are populations of organisms occupying the same ecological niche, whose divergence is purged recurrently by natural selection. These ecotypes can be discovered by several universal sequence-based approaches. These molecular methods suggest that a typical named species contains many ecotypes, each with the universal attributes of species. A named bacterial species is thus more like a genus than a species.}

A species-specific "codon pair bias" provides that some synonymous codon pairs are used more or less frequently than statistically predicted. We synthesized de novo large DNA molecules using hundreds of over-or underrepresented synonymous codon pairs to encode the poliovirus capsid protein. Underrepresented codon pairs caused decreased rates of protein translation, and polioviruses containing such amino acid-independent changes were attenuated in mice. Polioviruses thus customized were used to immunize mice and provided protective immunity after challenge. This "death by a thousand cuts" strategy could be generally applicable to attenuating many kinds of viruses.}

	abstract = {Quantification of evolutionary constraints via sequence conservation can be leveraged to annotate genomic functional sequences. Recent efforts addressing the converse of this relationship have identified many sites in metazoan genomes with molecular function but without detectable conservation between related species. Here, we discuss explanations and implications for these results considering both practical and theoretical issues. In particular, phylogenetic scope influences the relationship between sequence conservation and function. Comparisons of distantly related species can detect constraint with high specificity due to the loss of conserved neutral sequence, but sensitivity is sacrificed as a result of functional changes related to lineage-specific biology. The strength of natural selection operating on functional sequence is also important. Mutations to functional sequences that result in small fitness effects are subject to weaker constraints. Therefore, particularly when comparing highly divergent species, functional sequences that are degenerate or biologically redundant will be prone to turnover, wherein functional sequences are replaced by effectively equivalent, but nonorthologous counterparts. Finally, considering the size and complexity of metazoan genomes and the fact that many nonconserved sequences are associated with sequence-degenerate, low-level molecular functions, we find it likely that there exist many biochemically functional sequences that are not under constraint. This hypothesis does not lead to the conclusion that huge amounts of vertebrate genomes are functionally important, but rather that such "functionality" represents molecular noise that has weak or no effect on organismal phenotypes.}

However, the presence of operon copy number heterogeneity represents a source of systematic error in community analysis. To understand the types and magnitude of such bias, four commonly used rrn-based techniques were used to perform an in silico analysis of a hypothetical community comprised organisms from the Comprehensive Microbial Resource database. Community profiles were generated, and diversity indices were calculated for length heterogeneity PCR, automated ribosomal integenic spacer analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and terminal RFLP (using RsaI, MspI, and HhaI). The results demonstrate that all techniques present a quantitative bias toward organisms with higher copy numbers. In addition, techniques may underestimate diversity by grouping similar ribotypes or overestimate diversity by allowing multiple signals for one organism. The results of this study suggest that caution should be used when interpreting rrn-based community analysis techniques.}

Bacterial community composition was characterized with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA. Average community doubling time was calculated from bacterial production ([(14)C]leucine incorporation) and bacterial abundance (direct counts). Freshwater and marine populations advected into the estuary represented a large fraction of the bacterioplankton community in all seasons. However, a unique estuarine community formed at intermediate salinities in summer and fall, when average doubling time was much shorter than water residence time, but not in spring, when doubling time was similar to residence time. Sequencing of DNA in DGGE bands demonstrated that most bands represented single phylotypes and that matching bands from different samples represented identical phylotypes. Most river and coastal ocean bacterioplankton were members of common freshwater and marine phylogenetic clusters within the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and ACTINOBACTERIA: Estuarine bacterioplankton also belonged to these phyla but were related to clones and isolates from several different environments, including marine water columns, freshwater sediments, and soil.}

We used 16S rRNA gene microarrays to evaluate changes in the composition of grassland soil microbial communities under rainfall amendments simulating alternative climate change scenarios, and to compare these to responses of overlying plants and invertebrates. Following 5 years of rainfall manipulation, soil bacteria and archaea in plots where natural rain was supplemented differed little from ambient controls, despite profound treatment-related changes in the overlying grassland. During the sixth and seventh year, seasonal differences in bacterial and archaeal assemblages emerged among treatments, but only when watering exacerbated or alleviated periods of particularly aberrant conditions in the ambient climate. In contrast to effects on plants and invertebrates, effects on bacteria and archaea did not compound across seasons or years, indicating that soil microbial communities may be more robust than associated aboveground macroorganisms to certain alterations in climate.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 12 March 2009; doi:10.1038/ismej.2009.16.}

	abstract = {The absolute diversity of prokaryotes is widely held to be unknown and unknowable at any scale in any environment. However, it is not necessary to count every species in a community to estimate the number of different taxa therein. It is sufficient to estimate the area under the species abundance curve for that environment. Log-normal species abundance curves are thought to characterize communities, such as bacteria, which exhibit highly dynamic and random growth. Thus, we are able to show that the diversity of prokaryotic communities may be related to the ratio of two measurable variables: the total number of individuals in the community and the abundance of the most abundant members of that community. We assume that either the least abundant species has an abundance of 1 or Preston's canonical hypothesis is valid. Consequently, we can estimate the bacterial diversity on a small scale (oceans 160 per ml; soil 6,400-38,000 per g; sewage works 70 per ml). We are also able to speculate about diversity at a larger scale, thus the entire bacterial diversity of the sea may be unlikely to exceed 2 x 10(6), while a ton of soil could contain 4 x 10(6) different taxa. These are preliminary estimates that may change as we gain a greater understanding of the nature of prokaryotic species abundance curves. Nevertheless, it is evident that local and global prokaryotic diversity can be understood through species abundance curves and purely experimental approaches to solving this conundrum will be fruitless.}

	abstract = {Microbial resistance to antibiotics currently spans all known classes of natural and synthetic compounds. It has not only hindered our treatment of infections but also dramatically reshaped drug discovery, yet its origins have not been systematically studied. Soil-dwelling bacteria produce and encounter a myriad of antibiotics, evolving corresponding sensing and evading strategies. They are a reservoir of resistance determinants that can be mobilized into the microbial community. Study of this reservoir could provide an early warning system for future clinically relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms.}

	abstract = {Analysis of many bacterial genomes is impeded by the inability to separate individual species from complex mixtures of cells or to propagate cells in pure culture. This problem is an obstacle to the study of many bacterial symbionts that live intracellularly in insects and other animals. To recover bacterial DNA from complex samples, we devised a method that facilitates the cloning of DNA fragments of distinctive G+C contents in order to generate shotgun DNA libraries enriched in inserts having a specific base composition. DNA preparations are first treated with a restriction enzyme having a common cleavage site in a particular genome and then shotgun cloned following size-fractionation. This method was applied to whole bacteriomes of the psyllid, Pachypsylla venusta, which harbors the bacterial symbiont Candidatus Carsonella ruddii. The resulting libraries were highly enriched in bacterial sequences. Through the use of alternate enzymes and partial digests, this technique can be adapted to yield virtually pure DNA libraries for individual bacterial species.}

A naïve Bayesian classifier was built to discriminate between different bacterial compositions of short oligomers, also known as DNA words. The classifier has proven successful in identifying foreign genes in Neisseria meningitis. In this study we extend the classifier approach using either a fixed higher order Markov model (Mk) or a variable length Markov model (VLMk). RESULTS: We propose a simple algorithm to lock a variable length Markov model to a certain number of parameters and show that the use of Markov models greatly increases the flexibility and accuracy in prediction to that of a naïve model. We also test the integrity of classifiers in terms of false-negatives and give estimates of the minimal sizes of training data. We end the report by proposing a method to reject a false hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate taxonomy is best maintained if species are arranged as hierarchical groups in phylogenetic trees. This is especially important as trees grow larger as a consequence of a rapidly expanding sequence database. Hierarchical group names are typically manually assigned in trees, an approach that becomes unfeasible for very large topologies. RESULTS: We have developed an automated iterative procedure for delineating stable (monophyletic) hierarchical groups to large (or small) trees and naming those groups according to a set of sequentially applied rules. In addition, we have created an associated ungrouping tool for removing existing groups that do not meet user-defined criteria (such as monophyly). The procedure is implemented in a program called GRUNT (GRouping, Ungrouping, Naming Tool) and has been applied to the current release of the Greengenes (Hugenholtz) 16S rRNA gene taxonomy comprising more than 130,000 taxa. CONCLUSION: GRUNT will facilitate researchers requiring comprehensive hierarchical grouping of large tree topologies in, for example, database curation, microarray design and pangenome assignments. The application is available at the greengenes website 1.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: A typical metagenome dataset generated using a 454 pyrosequencing platform consists of short reads sampled from the collective genome of a microbial community. The amount of sequence in such datasets is usually insufficient for assembly, and traditional gene prediction cannot be applied to unassembled short reads. As a result, analysis of such datasets usually involves comparisons in terms of relative abundances of various protein families. The latter requires assignment of individual reads to protein families, which is hindered by the fact that short reads contain only a fragment, usually small, of a protein. RESULTS: We have considered the assignment of pyrosequencing reads to protein families directly using RPS-BLAST against COG and Pfam databases and indirectly via proxygenes that are identified using BLASTx searches against protein sequence databases. Using simulated metagenome datasets as benchmarks, we show that the proxygene method is more accurate than the direct assignment. We introduce a clustering method which significantly reduces the size of a metagenome dataset while maintaining a faithful representation of its functional and taxonomic content.}

But, of late, the discovery rate of novel biomolecules using traditional cultivation techniques has been extremely low, as most soil microorganisms cannot be cultured in this way. The development of novel cultivation-dependent and molecular cultivation-independent approaches has paved the way for a new era of product recovery from soil microorganisms. In particular, gene-mining based on the construction and screening of complex libraries derived from the soil metagenome provides opportunities to fully explore and exploit the enormous genetic and metabolic diversity of soil microorganisms. This strategy has already resulted in the isolation of novel biocatalysts and bioactive molecules.}

Soil metagenomics, which comprises isolation of soil DNA and the production and screening of clone libraries, can provide a cultivation-independent assessment of the largely untapped genetic reservoir of soil microbial communities. This approach has already led to the identification of novel biomolecules. However, owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of the biotic and abiotic components of soil ecosystems, the construction and screening of soil-based libraries is difficult and challenging.

	abstract = {Based on the hypothesis that highly expressed genes are often characterized by strong compositional bias in terms of codon usage, there are number of measures currently in use that quantify codon usage bias in genes, and hence provide numerical indices to predict the expression levels of genes. With the recent advent of expression measure from the score of relative codon bias (RCBS), we have explicitly tested the performance of this numerical measure to predict the gene expression level and illustrate this with an analysis of Yeast genomes. In contradiction with previous other studies, we observe a weak correlations between GC content and RCBS, but a selective pressure on the codon preferences in highly expressed genes. The assertion that the expression of a given gene depends on the score of relative codon usage bias (RCBS) is supported by the data. We further observe a strong correlation between RCBS and protein length indicating natural selection in favor of shorter genes to be expressed at higher level. We also attempt a statistical analysis to assess the strength of relative codon bias in genes as a guide to their likely expression level, suggesting a decrease of the informational entropy in the highly expressed genes.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Laterally transferred genes have often been identified on the basis of compositional features that distinguish them from ancestral genes in the genome. These genes are usually A+T-rich, arguing either that there is a bias towards acquiring genes from donor organisms having low G+C contents or that genes acquired from organisms of similar genomic base compositions go undetected in these analyses. RESULTS: By examining the genome contents of closely related, fully sequenced bacteria, we uncovered genes confined to a single genome and examined the sequence features of these acquired genes. The analysis shows that few transfer events are overlooked by compositional analyses. Most observed lateral gene transfers do not correspond to free exchange of regular genes among bacterial genomes, but more probably represent the constituents of phages or other selfish elements. CONCLUSIONS: Although bacteria tend to acquire large amounts of DNA, the origin of these genes remains obscure. We have shown that contrary to what is often supposed, their composition cannot be explained by a previous genomic context. In contrast, these genes fit the description of recently described genes in lambdoid phages, named 'morons'. Therefore, results from genome content and compositional approaches to detect lateral transfers should not be cited as evidence for genetic exchange between distantly related bacteria.}

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of gene nucleotide content in prokaryotic genomes is commonly interpreted as the result of three main phenomena: (1) genes undergo different selection pressures both during and after translation (affecting codon and amino acid choice); (2) genes undergo different mutational pressure whether they are on the leading or lagging strand; and (3) genes may have different phylogenetic origins as a result of lateral transfers. However, this view neglects the necessity of organizing genetic information on a chromosome that needs to be replicated and folded, which may add constraints to single gene evolution. As a consequence, genes are potentially subjected to different mutation and selection pressures, depending on their position in the genome. In this paper, we analyze the structuring of different codon usage measures along completely sequenced bacterial genomes. We show that most of them are highly structured, suggesting that genes have different base content, depending on their location on the chromosome. A peculiar pattern of genome structure, with a tendency toward an A+T-enrichment near the replication terminus, is found in most bacterial phyla and may reflect common chromosome constraints. Several species may have lost this pattern, probably because of genome rearrangements or integration of foreign DNA. We show that in several species, this enrichment is associated with an increase of evolutionary rate and we discuss the evolutionary implications of these results. We argue that structural constraints acting on the circular chromosome are not negligible and that this natural structuring of bacterial genomes may be a cause of overestimation in lateral gene transfer predictions using codon composition indices.}

Here we develop and analyze a set of >100 putative orthologous genes derived from genome comparisons. We aimed to minimize systematic errors that arise when reconstructing the Plasmodium phylogeny with a genome-scale data set by evaluating the congruence of different genes, optimality criteria, and models of sequence evolution with previous studies encompassing fewer characters and more species. Saturation in substitutions and bias in base frequencies at third-codon positions characterized most Plasmodium genes. Molecular evolution models that partitioned rates of change by codon position were best at accounting for these sequence characteristics, as were analyses of amino acid alignments. These methods also ameliorated, but did not entirely avoid, the impact of reduced taxon sampling on phylogeny. The use of these models and expanded taxon sampling are necessary to maximize detection of multiple substitutions, overcome compositional biases, and, ultimately, resolve with confidence the phylogeny of Plasmodium.}

	abstract = {Microbes commonly exist in milieus of varying complexity and diversity. Although cultivation-based techniques have been unable to accurately capture the true diversity within microbial communities, these deficiencies have been overcome by applying molecular approaches that target the universally conserved 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The recent application of 454 pyrosequencing to simultaneously sequence thousands of 16S rDNA sequences (pyrotags) has revolutionized the characterization of complex microbial communities. To date, studies based on 454 pyrotags have dominated the field, but sequencing platforms that generate many more sequence reads at much lower costs have been developed. Here, we use the Illumina sequencing platform to design a strategy for 16S amplicon analysis (iTags), and assess its generality, practicality and potential complications. We fabricated and sequenced paired-end libraries of amplified hyper-variable 16S rDNA fragments from sets of samples that varied in their contents, ranging from a single bacterium to highly complex communities. We adopted an approach that allowed us to evaluate several potential sources of errors, including sequencing artifacts, amplification biases, non-corresponding paired-end reads and mistakes in taxonomic classification. By considering each source of error, we delineate ways to make biologically relevant and robust conclusions from the millions of sequencing reads that can be readily generated by this technology.}

Advances in cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided a route to study microbial consortia in their natural surroundings and to begin resolving the community structure, dominant metabolic processes and inter-organism interactions. However, the utility of these methods generally scales inversely with community complexity. By applying genomics-enabled methods to the study of natural microbial communities with reduced levels of species richness, a relatively comprehensive understanding of the metabolic networks and evolutionary processes within these communities can be attained. In such well-defined model systems, it is also possible to link emergent ecological patterns to their molecular and evolutionary underpinnings, facilitating construction of predictive ecosystem models. In this study, we review over a decade of research on one such system-acid mine drainage biofilm communities. We discuss the value and limitations of tractable model microbial communities in developing molecular methods for microbial ecology and in uncovering principles that may explain behavior in more complex systems.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 18 February 2010; doi:10.1038/ismej.2009.158.}

	abstract = {Bacterial species concepts are controversial. More widely accepted is the need to understand how differences in gene content and sequence lead to ecological divergence. To address this relationship in ecosystem context, we investigated links between genotype and ecology of two genotypic groups of Leptospirillum group II bacteria in comprehensively characterized, natural acidophilic biofilm communities. These groups share 99.7\% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity and 95\% average amino acid identity between their orthologs. One genotypic group predominates during early colonization, and the other group typically proliferates in later successional stages, forming distinct patches tens to hundreds of micrometers in diameter. Among early colonizing populations, we observed dominance of five genotypes that differed from each other by the extent of recombination with the late colonizing type. Our analyses suggest that the specific recombinant variant within the early colonizing group is selected for by environmental parameters such as temperature, consistent with recombination as a mechanism for ecological fine tuning. Evolutionary signatures, and strain-resolved expression patterns measured via mass spectrometry-based proteomics, indicate increased cobalamin biosynthesis, (de)methylation, and glycine cleavage in the late colonizer. This may suggest environmental changes within the biofilm during development, accompanied by redirection of compatible solutes from osmoprotectants toward metabolism. Across 27 communities, comparative proteogenomic analyses show that differential regulation of shared genes and expression of a small subset of the approximately 15\% of genes unique to each genotype are involved in niche partitioning. In summary, the results show how subtle genetic variations can lead to distinct ecological strategies.}

	abstract = {Microbiologists conducting surveys of bacterial and archaeal diversity often require comparative alignments of thousands of 16S rRNA genes collected from a sample. The computational resources and bioinformatics expertise required to construct such an alignment has inhibited high-throughput analysis. It was hypothesized that an online tool could be developed to efficiently align thousands of 16S rRNA genes via the NAST (Nearest Alignment Space Termination) algorithm for creating multiple sequence alignments (MSA). The tool was implemented with a web-interface at http://greengenes.lbl.gov/NAST. Each user-submitted sequence is compared with Greengenes' 'Core Set', comprising approximately 10 000 aligned non-chimeric sequences representative of the currently recognized diversity among bacteria and archaea. User sequences are oriented and paired with their closest match in the Core Set to serve as a template for inserting gap characters. Non-16S data (sequence from vector or surrounding genomic regions) are conveniently removed in the returned alignment. From the resulting MSA, distance matrices can be calculated for diversity estimates and organisms can be classified by taxonomy. The ability to align and categorize large sequence sets using a simple interface has enabled researchers with various experience levels to obtain bacterial and archaeal community profiles.}

Base concentrations, stretches (runs of complementary bases or purines/pyrimidines), and patches (over- or underexpressed words of various lengths) are the main factors explaining the variability observed among sequences.

	abstract = {The human intestinal microbiota is essential to the health of the host and plays a role in nutrition, development, metabolism, pathogen resistance, and regulation of immune responses. Antibiotics may disrupt these coevolved interactions, leading to acute or chronic disease in some individuals. Our understanding of antibiotic-associated disturbance of the microbiota has been limited by the poor sensitivity, inadequate resolution, and significant cost of current research methods. The use of pyrosequencing technology to generate large numbers of 16S rDNA sequence tags circumvents these limitations and has been shown to reveal previously unexplored aspects of the "rare biosphere." We investigated the distal gut bacterial communities of three healthy humans before and after treatment with ciprofloxacin, obtaining more than 7,000 full-length rRNA sequences and over 900,000 pyrosequencing reads from two hypervariable regions of the rRNA gene. A companion paper in PLoS Genetics (see Huse et al., doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000255) shows that the taxonomic information obtained with these methods is concordant. Pyrosequencing of the V6 and V3 variable regions identified 3,300-5,700 taxa that collectively accounted for over 99\% of the variable region sequence tags that could be obtained from these samples. Ciprofloxacin treatment influenced the abundance of about a third of the bacterial taxa in the gut, decreasing the taxonomic richness, diversity, and evenness of the community. However, the magnitude of this effect varied among individuals, and some taxa showed interindividual variation in the response to ciprofloxacin. While differences of community composition between individuals were the largest source of variability between samples, we found that two unrelated individuals shared a surprising degree of community similarity. In all three individuals, the taxonomic composition of the community closely resembled its pretreatment state by 4 weeks after the end of treatment, but several taxa failed to recover within 6 months. These pervasive effects of ciprofloxacin on community composition contrast with the reports by participants of normal intestinal function and with prior assumptions of only modest effects of ciprofloxacin on the intestinal microbiota. These observations support the hypothesis of functional redundancy in the human gut microbiota. The rapid return to the pretreatment community composition is indicative of factors promoting community resilience, the nature of which deserves future investigation.}

This emerging field offers the potential to lay solid basis on our understanding of the entire living world. However, the taxonomic classification is an essential task in the analysis of metagenomics data sets that it is still far from being solved. We present a novel strategy to predict the taxonomic origin of environmental genomic fragments. The proposed classifier combines the idea of the k-nearest neighbor with strategies from kernel-based learning. RESULTS: Our novel strategy was extensively evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation strategy on fragments of variable length (800bp-50Kbp) from 373 completely sequenced genomes. TACOA is able to classify genomic fragments of length 800bp and 1Kbp with high accuracy until rank class. For longer fragments [greater than or equal to] 3Kbp accurate predictions are made at even deeper taxonomic ranks (oder and genus). Remarkably, TACOA also produces reliable results when the taxonomic origin of a fragment is not represented in the reference set, thus classifying such fragments to its known broader taxonomic class or simply as "unknown". We compared the classification accuracy of TACOA with the latest intrinsic classifier PhyloPythia using 63 recently published complete genomes. For fragments of length 800bp and 1Kbp the overall accuracy of TACOA is higher than that obtained by PhyloPythia at all taxonomic ranks. For all fragment lengths, both methods achieved comparable high specicity results up to rank class and low false negative rates are also obtained. CONCLUSIONS: An accurate multi-class taxonomic classifier was developed for environmental genomic fragments. TACOA can predict with high reliability the taxonomic origin of genomic fragments as short as 800bp. The proposed method is transparent, fast, accurate and the reference set can be easily updated as newly sequenced genomes become available. Moreover, the method demonstrated to be competitive when compared to the most current classifier PhyloPythia and has the advantage that it can be locally installed and the reference set can be kept up-to-date.}

These signatures have far-reaching implications for understanding genome evolution and potential application in classification of metagenomic sequence fragments. However, little is known regarding the distribution of genome signatures in natural microbial communities or the extent to which environmental factors shape them. RESULTS: We analyzed metagenomic sequence data from two acidophilic biofilm communities, including composite genomes reconstructed for nine archaea, three bacteria, and numerous associated viruses, as well as thousands of unassigned fragments from strain variants and low-abundance organisms. Genome signatures, in the form of tetranucleotide frequencies analyzed by emergent self-organizing maps, segregated sequences from all known populations sharing < 50-60\% average amino acid identity and revealed previously unknown genomic clusters corresponding to low-abundance organisms and a putative plasmid. Signatures were pervasive genome wide. Clusters were resolved because intra-genome differences resulting from translational selection or protein adaptation to the intracellular (pH ~5) versus extracellular (pH ~1) environment were small relative to inter-genome differences. We found that these genome signatures stem from multiple influences but are primarily manifested through codon composition, which we propose is the result of genome-specific mutational biases. CONCLUSIONS: An important conclusion is that shared environmental pressures and interactions among coevolving organisms do not obscure genome signatures in acid mine drainage communities. Thus, genome signatures can be used to assign sequence fragments to populations, an essential prerequisite if metagenomics is to provide ecological and biochemical insights into the functioning of microbial communities.}

	abstract = {From comparative analyses of the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding ribosomal RNAs and several proteins, molecular phylogeneticists have constructed a "universal tree of life," taking it as the basis for a "natural" hierarchical classification of all living things. Although confidence in some of the tree's early branches has recently been shaken, new approaches could still resolve many methodological uncertainties. More challenging is evidence that most archaeal and bacterial genomes (and the inferred ancestral eukaryotic nuclear genome) contain genes from multiple sources. If "chimerism" or "lateral gene transfer" cannot be dismissed as trivial in extent or limited to special categories of genes, then no hierarchical universal classification can be taken as natural. Molecular phylogeneticists will have failed to find the "true tree," not because their methods are inadequate or because they have chosen the wrong genes, but because the history of life cannot properly be represented as a tree. However, taxonomies based on molecular sequences will remain indispensable, and understanding of the evolutionary process will ultimately be enriched, not impoverished.}

	abstract = {Horizontal DNA transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity. Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up approximately 6\% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among approximately 12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures. Among the species studied, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus Influenzae and Escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect HTs.}

This review describes features of several oral bacterial genomes, and emphasizes the themes of species relationships, comparative genomics, and lateral gene transfer. Genomics is having a broad impact on basic research in microbial pathogenesis, and will lead to new approaches in clinical research and therapeutics.

Here, we introduce an approach that allows the phylogenetic signal in gene content to be applied to any set of sequences, using signature genes for phylogenetic classification. The hundreds of publicly available genomes allow us to identify signature genes at various taxonomic depths, and we show how the presence of signature genes in an unspecified sample can be used to characterize its taxonomic composition. We identify 8,362 signature genes specific for 112 prokaryotic taxa. We show that these signature genes can be used to address phylogenetic questions on the basis of gene content in cases where classic gene content or sequence analyses provide an ambiguous answer, such as for Nanoarchaeum equitans, and even in cases where complete genomes are not available, such as for metagenomics data. Cross-validation experiments leaving out up to 30\% of the species show that approximately 92\% of the signature genes correctly place the species in a related clade. Analyses of metagenomics data sets with the signature gene approach are in good agreement with the previously reported species distributions based on phylogenetic analysis of marker genes. Summarising, signature genes can complement traditional sequence based methods in addressing taxonomic questions.}

For example, oligonucleotide sequences that are over- or underrepresented can be identified by taking into account the overall genome composition and organization. One of the most overrepresented oligonucleotides in Escherichia coli is the Chi site, an octanucleotide that stimulates DNA repair by homologous recombination. Here we analyze the genomic distribution of Chi in E. coli and in the three other bacteria where a Chi sequence has been identified; note that Chi is a different sequence in each organism. For each bacterial genome, Chi sequences are frequent, regularly distributed, and overrepresented. This suggests that selection for Chi may have occurred during evolution to favor efficient repair of a damaged chromosome. Other characteristics of Chi distribution are not conserved and might reflect specific features of DNA repair in each host. The different sequence and characteristics of Chi in each microorganism suggest that selection for Chi occurred independently in different bacteria.}

	abstract = {Soil bacterial communities typically exhibit a distribution pattern in which most bacterial species are present in low abundance. Due to the relatively small size of most culture-independent sequencing surveys, a detailed phylogenetic analysis of rare members of the community is lacking. To gain access to the rarely sampled soil biosphere, we analyzed a dataset of 13,001 near full-length 16S rRNA gene clones derived from an undisturbed tall grass prairie soil in central Oklahoma. Rare members of the soil bacterial community (empirically defined at two different abundance cutoffs) represented 18.1\%-37.1\% of the total number of clones in the dataset and were, on average, less similar to their closest relatives in public databases when compared to more abundant members of the community. Detailed phylogenetic analyses indicated that members of the soil rare biosphere either belonged to novel bacterial lineages (members of five novel bacterial phyla identified in the dataset, as well as members of multiple novel lineages within previously described phyla or candidate phyla), lineages that are prevalent in other environments but rarely encountered in soil, or were close relatives to more abundant taxa in the dataset. While a fraction of the rare community was closely related to more abundant taxonomic groups in the dataset, a significant portion of the rare biosphere represented evolutionarily distinct lineages at various taxonomic cutoffs. We reason that these novelty and uniqueness patterns provide clues regarding the origins and potential ecological roles of members of the soil's rare biosphere.}

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons for microbial community profiling can, for equivalent costs, yield more than two orders of magnitude more sensitivity than traditional PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing. With this increased sensitivity and the ability to analyze multiple samples in parallel, it has become possible to evaluate several technical aspects of PCR-based community structure profiling methods. We tested the effect of amplicon length and primer pair on estimates of species richness (number of species) and evenness (relative abundance of species) by assessing the potentially tractable microbial community residing in the termite hindgut. Two regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced from one of two common priming sites, spanning the V1-V2 or V8 regions, using amplicons ranging in length from 352 to 1443 bp. Our results show that both amplicon length and primer pair markedly influence estimates of richness and evenness. However, estimates of species evenness are consistent among different primer pairs targeting the same region. These results highlight the importance of experimental methodology when comparing diversity estimates across communities.}

	abstract = {Chromosome organizations of related bacterial genera are well conserved despite a very long divergence period. We have assessed the forces limiting bacterial genome plasticity in Escherichia coli by measuring the respective effect of altering different parameters, including DNA replication, compositional skew of replichores, coordination of gene expression with DNA replication, replication-associated gene dosage, and chromosome organization into macrodomains. Chromosomes were rearranged by large inversions. Changes in the compositional skew of replichores, in the coordination of gene expression with DNA replication or in the replication-associated gene dosage have only a moderate effect on cell physiology because large rearrangements inverting the orientation of several hundred genes inside a replichore are only slightly detrimental. By contrast, changing the balance between the two replication arms has a more drastic effect, and the recombinational rescue of replication forks is required for cell viability when one of the chromosome arms is less than half than the other one. Macrodomain organization also appears to be a major factor restricting chromosome plasticity, and two types of inverted configurations severely affect the cell cycle. First, the disruption of the Ter macrodomain with replication forks merging far from the normal replichore junction provoked chromosome segregation defects. The second major problematic configurations resulted from inversions between Ori and Right macrodomains, which perturb nucleoid distribution and early steps of cytokinesis. Consequences for the control of the bacterial cell cycle and for the evolution of bacterial chromosome configuration are discussed.}

	abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of environmental samples. Because few tools exist for metagenomic analysis, a natural step has been to utilize the popular homology tool, BLAST, to search for sequence similarity between sample fragments and an administered database. Most biologists use this method today without knowing BLAST's accuracy, especially when a particular taxonomic class is under-represented in the database. The aim of this paper is to benchmark the performance of BLAST for taxonomic classification of metagenomic datasets in a supervised setting; meaning that the database contains microbes of the same class as the 'unknown' query fragments. We examine well- and under-represented genera and phyla in order to study their effect on the accuracy of BLAST. We conclude that on fine-resolution classes, such as genera, the accuracy of BLAST does not degrade very much with under-representation, but in a highly variant class, such as phyla, performance degrades significantly. Our analysis includes five-fold cross validation to substantiate our findings.}

	abstract = {Increasing pollution of water and soils by xenobiotic compounds has led in the last few decades to an acute need for understanding the impact of toxic compounds on microbial populations, the catabolic degradation pathways of xenobiotics and the set-up and improvement of bioremediation processes. Recent advances in molecular techniques, including high-throughput approaches such as microarrays and metagenomics, have opened up new perspectives and pointed towards new opportunities in pollution abatement and environmental management. Compared with traditional molecular techniques dependent on the isolation of pure cultures in the laboratory, microarrays and metagenomics allow specific environmental questions to be answered by exploring and using the phenomenal resources of uncultivable and uncharacterized micro-organisms. This paper reviews the current potential of microarrays and metagenomics to investigate the genetic diversity of environmentally relevant micro-organisms and identify new functional genes involved in the catabolism of xenobiotics.}

	abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the surprising richness of soil bacterial communities; however, bacteria are not the only microorganisms found in soil. To our knowledge, no study has compared the diversities of the four major microbial taxa, i.e., bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, from an individual soil sample. We used metagenomic and small-subunit RNA-based sequence analysis techniques to compare the estimated richness and evenness of these groups in prairie, desert, and rainforest soils. By grouping sequences at the 97\% sequence similarity level (an operational taxonomic unit [OTU]), we found that the archaeal and fungal communities were consistently less even than the bacterial communities. Although total richness levels are difficult to estimate with a high degree of certainty, the estimated number of unique archaeal or fungal OTUs appears to rival or exceed the number of unique bacterial OTUs in each of the collected soils. In this first study to comprehensively survey viral communities using a metagenomic approach, we found that soil viruses are taxonomically diverse and distinct from the communities of viruses found in other environments that have been surveyed using a similar approach. Within each of the four microbial groups, we observed minimal taxonomic overlap between sites, suggesting that soil archaea, bacteria, fungi, and viruses are globally as well as locally diverse.}

One of the largest human-associated microbial habitats is the skin surface, which harbors large numbers of bacteria that can have important effects on health. We examined the palmar surfaces of the dominant and nondominant hands of 51 healthy young adult volunteers to characterize bacterial diversity on hands and to assess its variability within and between individuals. We used a novel pyrosequencing-based method that allowed us to survey hand surface bacterial communities at an unprecedented level of detail. The diversity of skin-associated bacterial communities was surprisingly high; a typical hand surface harbored >150 unique species-level bacterial phylotypes, and we identified a total of 4,742 unique phylotypes across all of the hands examined. Although there was a core set of bacterial taxa commonly found on the palm surface, we observed pronounced intra- and interpersonal variation in bacterial community composition: hands from the same individual shared only 17\% of their phylotypes, with different individuals sharing only 13\%. Women had significantly higher diversity than men, and community composition was significantly affected by handedness, time since last hand washing, and an individual's sex. The variation within and between individuals in microbial ecology illustrated by this study emphasizes the challenges inherent in defining what constitutes a "healthy" bacterial community; addressing these challenges will be critical for the International Human Microbiome Project.}

	abstract = {An automated method of ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) was developed for the rapid estimation of microbial diversity and community composition in freshwater environments. Following isolation of total community DNA, PCR amplification of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region in the rRNA operon was performed with a fluorescence-labeled forward primer. ARISA-PCR fragments ranging in size from 400 to 1,200 bp were next discriminated and measured by using an automated electrophoresis system. Database information on the 16S-23S intergenic spacer was also examined, to understand the potential biases in diversity estimates provided by ARISA. In the analysis of three natural freshwater bacterial communities, ARISA was rapid and sensitive and provided highly reproducible community-specific profiles at all levels of replication tested. The ARISA profiles of the freshwater communities were quantitatively compared in terms of both their relative diversity and similarity level. The three communities had distinctly different profiles but were similar in their total number of fragments (range, 34 to 41). In addition, the pattern of major amplification products in representative profiles was not significantly altered when the PCR cycle number was reduced from 30 to 15, but the number of minor products (near the limit of detection) was sensitive to changes in cycling parameters. Overall, the results suggest that ARISA is a rapid and effective community analysis technique that can be used in conjunction with more accurate but labor-intensive methods (e.g., 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing) when fine-scale spatial and temporal resolution is needed.}

	abstract = {Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue, but it is becoming a force of global importance. Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.}

Phylogenetic analyses based on protein sequences are generally considered to be more reliable than those derived from the corresponding DNA sequences because it is believed that the use of encoded protein sequences circumvents the problems caused by nucleotide compositional biases in the DNA sequences. There exists, however, a correlation between AT/GC bias at the nucleotide level and content of AT- and GC-rich codons and their corresponding amino acids. Consequently, protein sequences can also be affected secondarily by nucleotide compositional bias. Here, we report that DNA bias not only may affect phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences, but also drives a protein bias which may affect analyses based on protein sequences. We present a striking example where common phylogenetic tools fail to recover the correct tree from complete animal mitochondrial protein-coding sequences. The data set is very extensive, containing several thousand sites per sequence, and the incorrect phylogenetic trees are statistically very well supported. Additionally, neither the use of the LogDet/paralinear transform nor removal of positions in the protein alignment with AT- or GC-rich codons allowed recovery of the correct tree. Two taxa with a large compositional bias continually group together in these analyses, despite a lack of close biological relatedness. We conclude that even protein-based phylogenetic trees may be misleading, and we advise caution in phylogenetic reconstruction using protein sequences, especially those that are compositionally biased.}

	abstract = {rRNA-based studies, which have become the most common method for assessing microbial communities, rely upon faithful amplification of the corresponding genes from the original DNA sample. We report here an analysis and reevaluation of commonly used primers for amplifying the DNA between positions 27 and 1492 of bacterial 16S rRNA genes (numbered according to the Escherichia coli rRNA). We propose a formulation for a forward primer (27f) that includes three sequences not usually present. We compare our proposed formulation to two common alternatives by using linear amplification-providing an assessment that is independent of a reverse primer-and in combination with the 1492 reverse primer (1492r) under the PCR conditions appropriate for making community rRNA gene clone libraries. For analyses of DNA from human vaginal samples, our formulation was better at maintaining the original rRNA gene ratio of Lactobacillus spp. to Gardnerella spp., particularly under stringent amplification conditions. Because our 27f formulation remains relatively simple, having seven distinct primer sequences, there is minimal loss of overall amplification efficiency and specificity.}

The obtained results showed good consistency between the phylogenetic trees prepared by these methods and likewise, the obtained classification of the herpesviruses was consistent with their current taxonomic designation. The herpesviruses with the ambiguous classification or not assigned in the family or with the newly published genomes were also phylogenetically classified.

	abstract = {The genes from the genome of the AT-rich bacterium Campylobacter jejuni were analysed and characterised with respect to usage and amino acid usage. Codon usage is generally biased for all amino acids having synonymous codons, so that AT-rich synonyms are most frequently used. Markov chain analysis showed that codon bias and over- or underrepresentation of the corresponding tri-letter words are not related. Predicted secondary structure, lipophilicity, codon position within the gene, strand, and position on the (+)-strand were all shown to be determinants of codon usage, and these effects were in part directly explained by compositional phenomena. Codon context and the GC-content at the wobble position of the fourfold degenerate sites exert indirect effects on codon usage. The factors that affect codon usage seem to affect all amino acids, rather than selected amino acids. The usage of amino acids correlates well with the GC-content of genes, i.e. usage of amino acids encoded by GC-rich codons increases with GC-content and vice versa.}

	abstract = {Factors influencing patterns in the distribution and abundance of plant and animal taxa modulate ecosystem function and ecosystem response to environmental change, which is often taken to infer low functional redundancy among such species, but such relationships are poorly known for microbial communities. Using high-resolution molecular fingerprinting, we demonstrate the existence of extraordinarily repeatable temporal patterns in the community composition of 171 operational taxonomic units of marine bacterioplankton over 4.5 years at our Microbial Observatory site, 20 km off the southern California coast. These patterns in distribution and abundance of microbial taxa were highly predictable and significantly influenced by a broad range of both abiotic and biotic factors. These findings provide statistically robust demonstration of temporal patterning in marine bacterial distribution and abundance, which suggests that the distribution and abundance of bacterial taxa may modulate ecosystem function and response and that a significant subset of the bacteria exhibit low levels of functional redundancy as documented for many plant and animal communities.}

	abstract = {Understanding the role of microbes in the oceans has focused on taxa that occur in high abundance; yet most of the marine microbial diversity is largely determined by a long tail of low-abundance taxa. This rare biosphere may have a cosmopolitan distribution because of high dispersal and low loss rates, and possibly represents a source of phylotypes that become abundant when environmental conditions change. However, the true ecological role of rare marine microorganisms is still not known. Here, we use pyrosequencing to describe the structure and composition of the rare biosphere and to test whether it represents cosmopolitan taxa or whether, similar to abundant phylotypes, the rare community has a biogeography. Our examination of 740,353 16S rRNA gene sequences from 32 bacterial and archaeal communities from various locations of the Arctic Ocean showed that rare phylotypes did not have a cosmopolitan distribution but, rather, followed patterns similar to those of the most abundant members of the community and of the entire community. The abundance distributions of rare and abundant phylotypes were different, following a log-series and log-normal model, respectively, and the taxonomic composition of the rare biosphere was similar to the composition of the abundant phylotypes. We conclude that the rare biosphere has a biogeography and that its tremendous diversity is most likely subjected to ecological processes such as selection, speciation, and extinction.}

This has led to many studies on the correlation between the guanine+cytosine (G+C) content of nucleic acids and temperature over the last 20 years. We collected the optimal growth temperatures (Topt) and the G+C contents of genomic DNA; 23S, 16S, and 5S ribosomal RNAs; and transfer RNAs for 764 prokaryotic species. No correlation was found between genomic G+C content and Topt, but there were striking correlations between the G+C content of ribosomal and transfer RNA stems and Topt. Two explanations have been proposed-neutral evolution and selection pressure-for the approximate equalities of G and C (respectively, A and T) contents within each strand of DNA molecules. Our results do not support the notion that selection pressure induces complementary oligonucleotides in close proximity and therefore numerous secondary structures in prokaryotic DNA, as the genomic G+C content does not behave in the same way as that of folded RNA with respect to optimal growth temperature.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data mining in large DNA sequences is a major challenge in microbial genomics and bioinformatics. Oligonucleotide usage (OU) patterns provide a wealth of information for large scale sequence analysis and visualization. The purpose of this research was to make OU statistical analysis available as a novel web-based tool for functional genomics and annotation. The tool is also available as a downloadable package. RESULTS: The SeqWord Genome Browser (SWGB) was developed to visualize the natural compositional variation of DNA sequences. The applet is also used for identification of divergent genomic regions both in annotated sequences of bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, phages and viruses, and in raw DNA sequences prior to annotation by comparing local and global OU patterns. The applet allows fast and reliable identification of clusters of horizontally transferred genomic islands, large multi-domain genes and genes for ribosomal RNA. Within the majority of genomic fragments (also termed genomic core sequence), regions enriched with housekeeping genes, ribosomal proteins and the regions rich in pseudogenes or genetic vestiges may be contrasted. CONCLUSION: The SWGB applet presents a range of comprehensive OU statistical parameters calculated for a range of bacterial species, plasmids and phages. It is available on the Internet at http://www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/mhhapplet.php.}

Reanalysis of reassociation kinetics for bacterial community DNA from pristine and metal-polluted soils showed that a power law best described the abundance distributions. More than one million distinct genomes occurred in the pristine soil, exceeding previous estimates by two orders of magnitude. Metal pollution reduced diversity more than 99.9\%, revealing the highly toxic effect of metal contamination, especially for rare taxa.}

However, to what extent such horizontal gene transfer (HGT) affects the core genealogical history of organisms remains controversial. Based on initial analyses of complete genomic sequences, HGT has been suggested to be so widespread that it might be the "essence of phylogeny" and might leave the treelike form of genealogy in doubt. On the other hand, possible biased estimation of HGT extent and the findings of coherent phylogenetic patterns indicate that phylogeny of life is well represented by tree graphs. Here, we reexamine this question by assessing the extent of HGT among core orthologous genes using a novel statistical method based on statistical comparisons of tree topology. We apply the method to 40 microbial genomes in the Clusters of Orthologous Groups database over a curated set of 297 orthologous gene clusters, and we detect significant HGT events in 33 out of 297 clusters over a wide range of functional categories. Estimates of positions of HGT events suggest a low mean genome-specific rate of HGT (2.0\%) among the orthologous genes, which is in general agreement with other quantitative of HGT. We propose that HGT events, even when relatively common, still leave the treelike history of phylogenies intact, much like cobwebs hanging from tree branches.}

	abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone through substantial technological evolution the technology involved in the publication of the results of these endeavors has remained relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document. <p /> In this paper we apply these concepts to a seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification of Cancer, Golub et al (1999). The authors of that paper have generously provided data and other information that have allowed us to largely reproduce their results. Rather than reproduce this paper exactly we demonstrate that such a reproduction is possible and instead concentrate on demonstrating the usefulness of the compendium concept itself.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metagenomics is a new field of research on natural microbial communities. High-throughput sequencing techniques like 454 or Solexa-Illumina promise new possibilities as they are able to produce huge amounts of data in much shorter time and with less efforts and costs than the traditional Sanger technique. But the data produced comes in even shorter reads (35-100 basepairs with Illumina, 100-500 basepairs with 454-sequencing). CARMA is a new software pipeline for the characterisation of species composition and the genetic potential of microbial samples using short, unassembled reads. RESULTS: In this paper, we introduce WebCARMA, a refined version of CARMA available as a web application for the taxonomic and functional classification of unassembled (ultra-)short reads from metagenomic communities. In addition, we have analysed the applicability of ultra-short reads in metagenomics. CONCLUSIONS: We show that unassembled reads as short as 35 bp can be used for the taxonomic classification of a metagenome.

In contrast to terrestrial ecosystems, microorganisms are the main form of biomass in the oceans, and form some of the largest populations on the planet. Theory predicts that selection should act more efficiently in large populations. But whether microbial plankton populations harbour organisms that are models of adaptive sophistication remains to be seen.

	abstract = {We developed a low-cost, high-throughput microbiome profiling method that uses combinatorial sequence tags attached to PCR primers that amplify the rRNA V6 region. Amplified PCR products are sequenced using an Illumina paired-end protocol to generate millions of overlapping reads. Combinatorial sequence tagging can be used to examine hundreds of samples with far fewer primers than is required when sequence tags are incorporated at only a single end. The number of reads generated permitted saturating or near-saturating analysis of samples of the vaginal microbiome. The large number of reads allowed an in-depth analysis of errors, and we found that PCR-induced errors composed the vast majority of non-organism derived species variants, an observation that has significant implications for sequence clustering of similar high-throughput data. We show that the short reads are sufficient to assign organisms to the genus or species level in most cases. We suggest that this method will be useful for the deep sequencing of any short nucleotide region that is taxonomically informative; these include the V3, V5 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes and the eukaryotic V9 region that is gaining popularity for sampling protist diversity.}

	abstract = {DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values have been used by bacterial taxonomists since the 1960s to determine relatedness between strains and are still the most important criterion in the delineation of bacterial species. Since the extent of hybridization between a pair of strains is ultimately governed by their respective genomic sequences, we examined the quantitative relationship between DDH values and genome sequence-derived parameters, such as the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of common genes and the percentage of conserved DNA. A total of 124 DDH values were determined for 28 strains for which genome sequences were available. The strains belong to six important and diverse groups of bacteria for which the intra-group 16S rRNA gene sequence identity was greater than 94 \%. The results revealed a close relationship between DDH values and ANI and between DNA-DNA hybridization and the percentage of conserved DNA for each pair of strains. The recommended cut-off point of 70 \% DDH for species delineation corresponded to 95 \% ANI and 69 \% conserved DNA. When the analysis was restricted to the protein-coding portion of the genome, 70 \% DDH corresponded to 85 \% conserved genes for a pair of strains. These results reveal extensive gene diversity within the current concept of "species". Examination of reciprocal values indicated that the level of experimental error associated with the DDH method is too high to reveal the subtle differences in genome size among the strains sampled. It is concluded that ANI can accurately replace DDH values for strains for which genome sequences are available.}

	abstract = {The many layers and structures of the skin serve as elaborate hosts to microbes, including a diversity of commensal and pathogenic bacteria that contribute to both human health and disease. To determine the complexity and identity of the microbes inhabiting the skin, we sequenced bacterial 16S small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes isolated from the inner elbow of five healthy human subjects. This analysis revealed 113 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; "phylotypes") at the level of 97\% similarity that belong to six bacterial divisions. To survey all depths of the skin, we sampled using three methods: swab, scrape, and punch biopsy. Proteobacteria dominated the skin microbiota at all depths of sampling. Interpersonal variation is approximately equal to intrapersonal variation when considering bacterial community membership and structure. Finally, we report strong similarities in the complexity and identity of mouse and human skin microbiota. This study of healthy human skin microbiota will serve to direct future research addressing the role of skin microbiota in health and disease, and metagenomic projects addressing the complex physiological interactions between the skin and the microbes that inhabit this environment.}

	abstract = {In this study codon usage bias of all experimentally known genes of Lactococcus lactis has been analyzed. Since Lactococcus lactis is an AT rich organism, it is expected to occur A and/or T at the third position of codons and detailed analysis of overall codon usage data indicates that A and/or T ending codons are predominant in this organism. However, multivariate statistical analyses based both on codon count and on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) detect a large number of genes, which are supposed to be highly expressed are clustered at one end of the first major axis, while majority of the putatively lowly expressed genes are clustered at the other end of the first major axis. It was observed that in the highly expressed genes C and T ending codons are significantly higher than the lowly expressed genes and also it was observed that C ending codons are predominant in the duets of highly expressed genes, whereas the T endings codons are abundant in the quartets. Abundance of C and T ending codons in the highly expressed genes suggest that, besides, compositional biases, translational selection are also operating in shaping the codon usage variation among the genes in this organism as observed in other compositionally skewed organisms. The second major axis generated by correspondence analysis on simple codon counts differentiates the genes into two distinct groups according to their hydrophobicity values, but the same analysis computed with relative synonymous codon usage values could not discriminate the genes according to the hydropathy values. This suggests that amino acid composition exerts constraints on codon usage in this organism. On the other hand the second major axis produced by correspondence analysis on RSCU values differentiates the genes into two groups according to the synonymous codon usage for cysteine residues (rarest amino acids in this organism), which is nothing but a artifactual effect induced by the RSCU values. Other factors such as length of the genes and the positions of the genes in the leading and lagging strand of replication have practically no influence in the codon usage variation among the genes in this organism.}

Yield of hybrids parented by the pyramided genotypes was more than 50\% higher than that of a control market leader variety under both wet and dry field conditions that received 10\% of the irrigation water.

Despite its significance, the biological mechanisms controlling anaerobic methane oxidation are not well characterized. One current model suggests that relatives of methane-producing Archaea developed the capacity to reverse methanogenesis and thereby to consume methane to produce cellular carbon and energy. We report here a test of the "reverse-methanogenesis" hypothesis by genomic analyses of methane-oxidizing Archaea from deep-sea sediments. Our results show that nearly all genes typically associated with methane production are present in one specific group of archaeal methanotrophs. These genome-based observations support previous hypotheses and provide an informed foundation for metabolic modeling of anaerobic methane oxidation.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has allowed bacteria to evolve many new capabilities. Because transferred genes perform many medically important functions, such as conferring antibiotic resistance, improved detection of horizontally transferred genes from sequence data would be an important advance. Existing sequence-based methods for detecting HGT focus on changes in nucleotide composition or on differences between gene and genome phylogenies; these methods have high error rates. RESULTS: First, we introduce a new class of methods for detecting HGT based on the changes in nucleotide substitution rates that occur when a gene is transferred to a new organism. Our new methods discriminate simulated HGT events with an error rate up to 10 times lower than does GC content. Use of models that are not time-reversible is crucial for detecting HGT. Second, we show that using combinations of multiple predictors of HGT offers substantial improvements over using any single predictor, yielding as much as a factor of 18 improvement in performance (a maximum reduction in error rate from 38\% to about 3\%). Multiple predictors were combined by using the random forests machine learning algorithm to identify optimal classifiers that separate HGT from non-HGT trees. CONCLUSION: The new class of HGT-detection methods introduced here combines advantages of phylogenetic and compositional HGT-detection techniques. These new techniques offer order-of-magnitude improvements over compositional methods because they are better able to discriminate HGT from non-HGT trees under a wide range of simulated conditions. We also found that combining multiple measures of HGT is essential for detecting a wide range of HGT events. These novel indicators of horizontal transfer will be widely useful in detecting HGT events linked to the evolution of important bacterial traits, such as antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.}

We also address one key question emerging from various Human Microbiome Projects: Is there a substantial core of abundant organisms or lineages that we all share? It appears that in some human body habitats, such as the hand and the gut, the diversity among individuals is so great that we can rule out the possibility that any species is at high abundance in all individuals: It is possible that the focus should instead be on higher-level taxa or on functional genes instead.}

In this study, we explored how these choices affected a survey of microbial diversity in a sample taken from the aerobic basin of the activated sludge of a North Carolina wastewater treatment plant. We performed pyrosequencing reactions on PCR products generated from primers targeting the V1-V2, V6, and V6-V7 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We compared these sequences to 16S rRNA gene sequences found in a whole-genome shotgun pyrosequencing run performed on the same sample. We found that sequences generated from primers targeting the V1-V2 variable region had the best match to the whole-genome shotgun reaction across a range of taxonomic classifications from phylum to family. Pronounced differences between primer sets, however, occurred in the "rare biosphere" involving taxa that we observed in fewer than 11 sequences. We also examined the results of analysis strategies comparing a classification scheme using a nearest-neighbor approach to directly classifying sequences with a naïve Bayesian algorithm. Again, we observed pronounced differences between these analysis schemes in infrequently observed taxa. We conclude that if a study is meant to probe the rare biosphere, both the experimental conditions and analysis choices will have a profound impact on the observed results.}

	abstract = {Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiporter, RecA, DNA polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Phylogenomic approaches towards functional and evolutionary annotation of unknown sequences have been suggested to be superior to those based only on pairwise local alignments. User-friendly software tools making the advantages of phylogenetic annotation available for the ever widening range of bioinformatically uninitiated biologists involved in genome/EST annotation projects are, however, not available. We were particularly confronted with this issue in the annotation of sequences from different groups of complex algae originating from secondary endosymbioses, where the identification of the phylogenetic origin of genes is often more problematic than in taxa well represented in the databases (e.g. animals, plants or fungi). RESULTS: We present a flexible pipeline with a user-friendly, interactive graphical user interface running on desktop computers that automatically performs a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search of query sequences, selects a representative subset of them, then creates a multiple alignment from the selected sequences, and finally computes a phylogenetic tree. The pipeline, named PhyloGena, uses public domain software for all standard bioinformatics tasks (similarity search, multiple alignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction). As the major technological innovation, selection of a meaningful subset of BLAST hits was implemented using logic programming, mimicing the selection procedure (BLAST tables, multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees) are displayed graphically, allowing the user to interact with the pipeline and deduce the function and phylogenetic origin of the query. PhyloGena thus makes phylogenomic annotation available also for those biologists without access to large computing facilities and with little informatics background. Although phylogenetic annotation is particularly useful when working with composite genomes (e.g. from complex algae), PhyloGena can be helpful in expressed sequence tag and genome annotation also in other organisms. AVAILABILITY: PhyloGena (executables for LINUX and Windows 2000/XP as well as source code) is available by anonymous ftp from http://www.awi.de/en/phylogena.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Metagenomics is an approach to the characterization of microbial genomes via the direct isolation of genomic sequences from the environment without prior cultivation. The amount of metagenomic sequence data is growing fast while computational methods for metagenome analysis are still in their infancy. In contrast to genomic sequences of single species, which can usually be assembled and analyzed by many available methods, a large proportion of metagenome data remains as unassembled anonymous sequencing reads. One of the aims of all metagenomic sequencing projects is the identification of novel genes. Short length, for example, Sanger sequencing yields on average 700 bp fragments, and unknown phylogenetic origin of most fragments require approaches to gene prediction that are different from the currently available methods for genomes of single species. In particular, the large size of metagenomic samples requires fast and accurate methods with small numbers of false positive predictions. RESULTS: We introduce a novel gene prediction algorithm for metagenomic fragments based on a two-stage machine learning approach. In the first stage, we use linear discriminants for monocodon usage, dicodon usage and translation initiation sites to extract features from DNA sequences. In the second stage, an artificial neural network combines these features with open reading frame length and fragment GC-content to compute the probability that this open reading frame encodes a protein. This probability is used for the classification and scoring of gene candidates. With large scale training, our method provides fast single fragment predictions with good sensitivity and specificity on artificially fragmented genomic DNA. Additionally, this method is able to predict translation initiation sites accurately and distinguishes complete from incomplete genes with high reliability. CONCLUSION: Large scale machine learning methods are well-suited for gene prediction in metagenomic DNA fragments. In particular, the combination of linear discriminants and neural networks is promising and should be considered for integration into metagenomic analysis pipelines.

	abstract = {The rRNA approach is the principal tool to study microbial diversity, but it has important biases. These include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers bias, and relative inefficiency of DNA extraction techniques. Such sources of potential undersampling of microbial diversity are well known, but the scale of the undersampling has not been quantified. Using a marine tidal flat bacterial community as a model, we show that even with unlimited sampling and sequencing effort, a single combination of PCR primers/DNA extraction technique enables theoretical recovery of only half of the richness recoverable with three such combinations. This shows that different combinations of PCR primers/DNA extraction techniques recover in principle different species, as well as higher taxa. The majority of earlier estimates of microbial richness seem to be underestimates. The combined use of multiple PCR primer sets, multiple DNA extraction techniques, and deep community sequencing will minimize the biases and recover substantially more species than prior studies, but we caution that even this-yet to be used-approach may still leave an unknown number of species and higher taxa undetected.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 20 August 2009; doi:10.1038/ismej.2009.89.}

This species-area relationship, thought to be one of the few laws in ecology, is fundamental to our understanding of the distribution of global biodiversity. However, such a relationship has not been reported for bacteria, and little is known regarding the spatial distribution of bacteria, relative to what is known of plants and animals. Here we describe a taxa-area relationship for bacteria over a scale of centimetres to hundreds of metres in salt marsh sediments. We found that bacterial communities located close together were more similar in composition than communities located farther apart, and we used the decay of community similarity with distance to show that bacteria can exhibit a taxa-area relationship. This relationship was driven primarily by environmental heterogeneity rather than geographic distance or plant composition.}

	abstract = {Very little is known about the structure of microbial communities, despite their abundance and importance to ecosystem processes. Recent work suggests that bacterial biodiversity might exhibit patterns similar to those of plants and animals. However, relative to our knowledge about the diversity of macro-organisms, we know little about patterns of relatedness in free-living bacterial communities, and relatively few studies have quantitatively examined community structure in a phylogenetic framework. Here we apply phylogenetic tools to bacterial diversity data to determine whether bacterial communities are phylogenetically structured. We find that bacterial communities tend to contain lower taxonomic diversity and are more likely to be phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance. Such phylogenetic clustering may indicate the importance of habitat filtering (where a group of closely related species shares a trait, or suite of traits, that allow them to persist in a given habitat) in the assembly of bacterial communities. Microbial communities are especially accessible for phylogenetic analysis and thus have the potential to figure prominently in the integration of evolutionary biology and community ecology.}

To establish the extent of and changes in the diversity of antibiotic resistance patterns in natural populations, we determined the MICs of five antibiotics for collections of enteric bacteria isolated from diverse hosts and geographic locations and during periods before and after commercial application of antibiotics began. All of the pre-antibiotic era strains were susceptible to high levels of these antibiotics, whereas 20\% of strains from contemporary populations of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica displayed high-level resistance to at least one of the antibiotics. In addition to the increase in the frequency of high-level resistance, background levels, conferred by genes providing nonspecific low-level resistance to multiple antibiotics, were significantly higher among contemporary strains. Changes in the incidence and levels of antibiotic resistance are not confined to particular segments of the bacterial population and reflect responses to the increased exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds over the past several decades.}

We investigated both aspects of population structure for microbial communities at two neighboring hydrothermal vents by examining the sequences of more than 900,000 microbial small-subunit ribosomal RNA amplicons. The two vent communities have different population structures that reflect local geochemical regimes. Descriptions of archaeal diversity were nearly exhaustive, but despite collecting an unparalleled number of sequences, statistical analyses indicated additional bacterial diversity at every taxonomic level. We predict that hundreds of thousands of sequences will be necessary to capture the vast diversity of microbial communities, and that different patterns of evenness for both high- and low-abundance taxa may be important in defining microbial ecosystem dynamics.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Massively parallel pyrosequencing systems have increased the efficiency of DNA sequencing, although the published per-base accuracy of a Roche GS20 is only 96\%. In genome projects, highly redundant consensus assemblies can compensate for sequencing errors. In contrast, studies of microbial diversity that catalogue differences between PCR amplicons of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) or other conserved gene families cannot take advantage of consensus assemblies to detect and minimize incorrect base calls. RESULTS: We performed an empirical study of the per-base error rate for the Roche GS20 system using sequences of the V6 hypervariable region from cloned microbial ribosomal DNA (tag sequencing). We calculated a 99.5\% accuracy rate in unassembled sequences, and identified several factors that can be used to remove a small percentage of low-quality reads, improving the accuracy to 99.75\% or better. CONCLUSION: By using objective criteria to eliminate low quality data, the quality of individual GS20 sequence reads in molecular ecological applications can surpass the accuracy of traditional capillary methods.}

	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of hypervariable regions from small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes can sample a microbial community two or three orders of magnitude more deeply per dollar and per hour than capillary sequencing of full-length SSU rRNA. As with full-length rRNA surveys, each sequence read is a tag surrogate for a single microbe. However, rather than assigning taxonomy by creating gene trees de novo that include all experimental sequences and certain reference taxa, we compare the hypervariable region tags to an extensive database of rRNA sequences and assign taxonomy based on the best match in a Global Alignment for Sequence Taxonomy (GAST) process. The resulting taxonomic census provides information on both composition and diversity of the microbial community. To determine the effectiveness of using only hypervariable region tags for assessing microbial community membership, we compared the taxonomy assigned to the V3 and V6 hypervariable regions with the taxonomy assigned to full-length SSU rRNA sequences isolated from both the human gut and a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. The hypervariable region tags and full-length rRNA sequences provided equivalent taxonomy and measures of relative abundance of microbial communities, even for tags up to 15\% divergent from their nearest reference match. The greater sampling depth per dollar afforded by massively parallel pyrosequencing reveals many more members of the "rare biosphere" than does capillary sequencing of the full-length gene. In addition, tag sequencing eliminates cloning bias and the sequences are short enough to be completely sequenced in a single read, maximizing the number of organisms sampled in a run while minimizing chimera formation. This technique allows the cost-effective exploration of changes in microbial community structure, including the rare biosphere, over space and time and can be applied immediately to initiatives, such as the Human Microbiome Project.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of ribosomal RNA genes (OFRG) is a procedure that sorts rRNA gene (rDNA) clones into taxonomic groups through a series of hybridization experiments. The hybridization signals are classified into three discrete values 0, 1 and N, where 0 and 1, respectively, specify negative and positive hybridization events and N designates an uncertain assignment. This study examined various approaches for classifying the values including Bayesian classification with normally distributed signal data, Bayesian classification with the exponentially distributed data, and with gamma distributed data, along with tree-based classification. All classification data were clustered using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean. RESULTS: The performance of each classification/clustering procedure was compared with results from known reference data. Comparisons indicated that the approach using the Bayesian classification with normal densities followed by tree clustering out-performed all others. The paper includes a discussion of how this Bayesian approach may be useful for the analysis of gene expression data.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The endosymbiotic birth of organelles is accompanied by massive transfer of endosymbiont genes to the eukaryotic host nucleus. In the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana the Psb28 protein is encoded in the plastid genome while a second version is nuclear-encoded and possesses a bipartite N-terminal presequence necessary to target the protein into the diatom complex plastid. Thus it can represent a gene captured during endosymbiotic gene transfer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To specify the origin of nuclear- and plastid-encoded Psb28 in T. pseudonana we have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of both mentioned genes. We have also experimentally tested the intracellular location of the nuclear-encoded Psb28 protein (nuPsb28) through transformation of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum with the gene in question fused to EYFP. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We show here that both versions of the psb28 gene in T. pseudonana are transcribed. We also provide experimental evidence for successful targeting of the nuPsb28 fused with EYFP to the diatom complex plastid. Extensive phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that nucleotide composition of the analyzed genes deeply influences the tree topology and that appropriate methods designed to deal with a compositional bias of the sequences and the long branch attraction artefact (LBA) need to be used to overcome this obstacle. We propose that nuclear psb28 in T. pseudonana is a duplicate of a plastid localized version, and that it has been transferred from its endosymbiont.}

	abstract = {Acidobacteria are ubiquitous and abundant members of soil bacterial communities. However, an ecological understanding of this important phylum has remained elusive because its members have been difficult to culture and few molecular investigations have focused exclusively on this group. We generated an unprecedented number of acidobacterial DNA sequence data using pyrosequencing and clone libraries (39 707 and 1787 sequences, respectively) to characterize the relative abundance, diversity and composition of acidobacterial communities across a range of soil types. To gain insight into the ecological characteristics of acidobacterial taxa, we investigated the large-scale biogeographic patterns exhibited by acidobacterial communities, and related soil and site characteristics to acidobacterial community assemblage patterns. The 87 soils analyzed by pyrosequencing contained more than 8600 unique acidobacterial phylotypes (at the 97\% sequence similarity level). One phylotype belonging to Acidobacteria subgroup 1, but not closely related to any cultured representatives, was particularly abundant, accounting for 7.4\% of bacterial sequences and 17.6\% of acidobacterial sequences, on average, across the soils. The abundance of Acidobacteria relative to other bacterial taxa was highly variable across the soils examined, but correlated strongly with soil pH (R=-0.80, P<0.001). Soil pH was also the best predictor of acidobacterial community composition, regardless of how the communities were characterized, and the relative abundances of the dominant Acidobacteria subgroups were readily predictable. Acidobacterial communities were more phylogenetically clustered as soil pH departed from neutrality, suggesting that pH is an effective habitat filter, restricting community membership to progressively more narrowly defined lineages as pH deviates from neutrality.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 8 January 2009; doi:10.1038/ismej.2008.127.}

	abstract = {A common strategy of pathogenic bacteria is to form close associations with parasitic insects that feed on animals and to use these insects as vectors for their own transmission. Pathogens interact closely with other coexisting bacteria within the insect, and interactions between co-occurring bacteria may influence the vector competency of the parasite. Interactions between particular lineages can be explored through measures of alpha-diversity. Furthermore, general patterns of bacterial community assembly can be explored through measures of beta-diversity. Here, we use pyrosequencing (n=115,924 16S rRNA gene sequences) to describe the bacterial communities of 230 prairie dog fleas sampled across space and time. We use these communinty characterizations to assess interactions between dominant community members and to explore general patterns of bacterial community assembly in fleas. An analysis of co-occurrence patterns suggests non-neutral negative interactions between dominant community members (P<0.001). Furthermore, bacterial communities of fleas shift dramatically across years (phylotype-based: R=0.829, P<0.001; phylogenetic-based: R=0.612-0.753, P<0.001), but they also significantly differ across space (phylotype-based: R=0.418, P<0.001; phylogenetic-based: R=0.290-0.328, P<0.001) and between flea species (phylotype-based: R=0.160, P=0.011; phylogenetic-based: not significant). Collectively, our results show that flea-associated bacterial communities are not random assemblages; rather, an individual flea's bacterial community is governed by interactions between bacterial lineages and by the flea's place in space and time.}

	abstract = {Existing general definitions of beta diversity often produce a beta with a hidden dependence on alpha. Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity. To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha x beta = gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.}

	abstract = {In bacteriophage T4, a major portion of DNA replication is initiated at random along the map, although several proven and putative origins have been described for early replication. In order to analyze the contribution of transcription and translation as well as DNA replication to intra-strand bias from A = T and G = C, we examined the pattern of the intra-strand biases in the first, second, and third codon positions of the coding regions as well as the intergenic regions of the T4 genome. We found, along the map, characteristic biases both from A = T and G = C for each codon position and the intergenic regions. The bias patterns were closely associated with the location of the sense and anti-sense segments in the genome. The results suggest that: (1) transcription-associated mutation is likely a significant cause of the bias, which is suggested by the pattern of the AT bias (bias from A = T) in the third codon position; (2) DNA replication coupled bias may also exist, which is suggested by the pattern of the GC bias (bias from G = C) in the third codon position and the intergenic regions; and (3) the bias patterns of the first and second codon positions of the sense segments are consistent with universal properties of the coding sequence that G is in excess and T is deficient in the first codon position, and G is deficient in the second codon position.}

	abstract = {Nearly complete genome sequences of three novel RNA viruses were acquired from the stool of an Afghanistani child. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these viruses belong to the picorna-like virus superfamily. Because of their unique genomic organization and deep phylogenetic roots we propose these viruses provisionally named calhevirus, tetnovirus-1 and tetnovirus-2 as prototypes of new viral families. A newly developed nucleotide composition analysis (NCA) method was used to compare mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies of RNA viruses infecting mammals, plants, or insects. Using a large training dataset of 284 representative sequences of picornavirus-like genomic sequences with defined host origins, NCA correctly identified the kingdom or phylum of the viral host of >95\% of known RNA viruses. Applying this analysis method to the new sequences obtained in the current study, NCA predicted an insect host origin for the 3 novel picorna-like viruses. Their presence in human stool therefore likely reflects ingestion of insect contaminated food. The NCA method provides a rapid and robust method to provisionally identify the likely hosts of highly divergent viral genomes. The genetic diversity of the picorna-like virus supergroup is likely to continue to expand as metagenomic analysis of different environments continues to provide novel genome sequences.}

	abstract = {Counts and spacings of all 4- and 6-bp palindromes in DNA sequences from a broad range of organisms were investigated. Both 4- and 6-bp average palindrome counts were significantly low in all bacteriophages except one, probably as a means of avoiding restriction enzyme cleavage. The exception, T4 of normal 4- and 6-palindrome counts, putatively derives protection from modification of cytosine to hydroxymethylcytosine plus glycosylation. The counts and distributions of 4-bp and of 6-bp restriction sites in bacterial species are variable. Bacterial cells with multiple restriction systems for 4-bp or 6-bp target specificities are low in aggregate 4- or 6-bp palindrome counts/kb, respectively, but bacterial cells lacking exact 4-cutter enzymes generally show normal or high counts of 4-bp palindromes when compared with random control sequences of comparable nucleotide frequencies. For example, E. coli, apparently without an exact 4-bp target restriction endonuclease (see text), contains normal aggregate 4-palindrome counts/kb, while B. subtilis, which abounds with 4-bp restriction systems, shows a significant under-representation of 4-palindrome counts. Both E. coli and B. subtilis have many 6-bp restriction enzymes and concomitantly diminished aggregate 6-palindrome counts/kb. Eukaryote, viral, and organelle sequences generally have aggregate 4- and 6-palindromic counts/kb in the normal range. Interpretations of these results are given in terms of restriction/methylation regimes, recombination and transcription processes, and possible structural and regulatory roles of 4- and 6-bp palindromes.}

These include: (a) characterizations of short oligonucleotide biases and general compositional tendencies; (b) molecular evolutionary reconstructions based on dinucleotide relative abundance distance measures and partial orderings; and (c) the application of r-scan statistics, quantile distributions, and score-based analyses to identify clustering, overdispersion, and excessive evenness in the distribution of a marker array along a sequence. These apply, for example, to restriction sites, microsatellite runs, regulatory motifs, and nucleosome placements. Furthermore, (d) the definition and determination of rare and frequent oligonucleotides and peptides provides another perspective on sequence heterogeneity, and (e) score methods are also applied in exon and gene locations. Most of the ideas and methods are illustrated with respect to bacteriophage genomes, to megabase amounts of several eukaryotic sequences, to a diverse collection of bacterial sets, to mitochondrial chromosomes, and to a broad assembly of viral genomes.}

Most retrotransposons in eukaryotic species also show low CpG relative abundances. Interpretations, especially in some cases of DNA viruses or viruses with a DNA intermediate, might relate to methylation effects and modes of viral integration and excision. Other possible contributing factors relate to dinucleotide stacking energies, special mutation mechanisms, and evolutionary events.}

Pairwise similarity scores were determined by a novel method based on significant segment pair alignment. The sequences of different species were grouped on the basis of mutually high similarity scores within groups and consistency of score ranges in comparison to other groups. Following this protocol, the gamma-proteobacteria can be subclassified into two major groups, those of mostly vertebrate hosts and those of mostly soil habitat. The alpha-proteobacterial sequences also divide into two distinct groups, whereas classification of the beta-proteobacteria is more complex. The gram-positive bacterial sequences split into three groups of low and three groups of high G+C genome content. However, neither the combined low-G+C-content nor the combined high-G+C-content group nor the aggregate of all gram-positive bacteria form homogeneous groups. The mycoplasma sequences score best with the Bacillus subtilis sequence, consistent with their presumed origin from a gram-positive ancestor. The eukaryotic RAD proteins generally show a single high-scoring segment pair with the proteobacterial RecA sequences around the ATP-binding domain. The bacteriophage T4 UvsX protein aligns best with RecA sequences on two segments disjoint from the ATP-binding domain. The distribution of the most highly conserved regions shared between RecA and noneubacterial RecA-like sequences suggests a mosaic character and evolution of RecA. The discussion considers some questions on the validity and consistency of bacterial classifications derived from RecA sequence comparisons.}

Analysis of currently available genomic sequence data has extended these earlier results, showing that the general designs of disjoint samples of a genome are substantially more similar to each other than to those of sequences from other organisms and that closely related organisms have similar general designs. From this perspective, the set of dinucleotide odds ratio (relative abundance) values constitute a signature of each DNA genome, which can discriminate between sequences from different organisms. Dinucleotide-odds ratio values appear to reflect not only the chemistry of dinucleotide stacking energies and base-step conformational preferences, but also the species-specific properties of DNA modification, replication and repair mechanisms.}

Along these lines, new methods for identifying frequent words (oligonucleotides and/or peptides) and their distributions are applied to the H.influenzae genome with some comparisons and contrasts made with frequent words of other bacterial genomes. Three major classes of frequent oligonucleotides stand out: (i) oligos related to the familiar uptake signal sequences (USSs), AAGTGCGGT (USS+) and its inverted complement (USS-), (ii) multiple tetranucleotide iterations and (iii) intergenic dyad sequences (ISDs) found as AAGCCCACCCTAC and its dyad form. The USS+ and USS- occur in almost equal counts, are remarkably evenly spaced around the genome, and appear predominantly in the same reading frame of protein coding domains (USS+ translated to Ser-Ala-Val, USS- translated to Thr-Ala-Leu). These observations suggest that USSs contribute to global genomic functions, for example, in replication and/or repair processes, or as membrane attachment sites, or as sequences helping to pack DNA. The long tetranucleotide iterations, virtually unique to H.influenzae (i.e., unknown in other prokaryotes), through polymerase slippage during replication and/or homologous recombination may produce subpopulations expressing alternative proteins. The 13 bp frequent IDS words, invariably intergenic, occur mostly in clusters and provide potential for complex secondary structures suggesting that these sequences may be important signals for regulating the activity of their flanking genes. The frequent oligopeptides of H.influenzae are principally of two kinds--those induced by oligonucleotide frequent words (USSs, tetranucleotide iterations), and those associated with ATP or GTP binding sites that are generally composed of three motifs: the A-box which contributes to delineating the binding pocket; the B-box which functions in hydrolysis; and the C-box whose function is unknown. The A-box occurs fairly universally in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The B- and C-motifs appear to be specialized to various functional groups (e.g., transport, recombination, chaperone activity). Other putative motifs correspond to homologs of Escherichia coli motifs, for example, are associated with proteins of transcriptional processing, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and proteins functioning in electron transfer.}

	abstract = {We compare and contrast genome-wide compositional biases and distributions of short oligonucleotides across 15 diverse prokaryotes that have substantial genomic sequence collections. These include seven complete genomes (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early evolution of eukaryotes.}

Comparisons within and between species sample sequences are based on the profile of dinucleotide relative abundance values (The profile is rho*XY = f*XY/f*Xf*Y for all XY, where f*X denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and f*XY denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complement). Previous studies with respect to prokaryotes and this study document that profiles of different DNA sequence samples (sample size >/=50 kb) from the same organism are generally much more similar to each other than they are to profiles from other organisms, and that closely related organisms generally have more similar profiles than do distantly related organisms. On this basis we refer to the collection (rho*XY) as the genome signature. This paper identifies rho*XY extremes and compares genome signature differences for a diverse range of eukaryotic species. Interpretations on the mechanisms maintaining these profile differences center on genome-wide replication, repair, DNA structures, and context-dependent mutational biases. It is also observed that mitochondrial genome signature differences between species parallel the corresponding nuclear genome signature differences despite large differences between corresponding mitochondrial and nuclear signatures. The genome signature differences also have implications for contrasts between rodents and other mammals, and between monocot and dicot plants, as well as providing evidence for similarities among fungi and the diversity of protists.}

Analyses of currently available genomic sequence data have extended these earlier results, showing that the dinucleotide biases evaluated for successive 50 kb segments of a genome are significantly more similar to each other than to those of sequences from more distant organisms. From this perspective, the set of dinucleotide biases constitutes a 'genomic signature' that can discriminate sequences from different organisms. The dinucleotide biases appear to reflect species-specific properties of DNA stacking energies, modification, replication, and repair mechanisms. The genomic signature is useful for detecting pathogenicity islands in bacterial genomes.}

	abstract = {A new measure for assessing codon bias of one group of genes with respect to a second group of genes is introduced. In this formulation, codon bias correlations for Escherichia coli genes are evaluated for level of expression, for contrasts along genes, for genes in different 200 kb (or longer) contigs around the genome, for effects of gene size, for variation over different function classes, for codon bias in relation to possible lateral transfer and for dicodon bias for some gene classes. Among the function classes, codon biases of ribosomal proteins are the most deviant from the codon frequencies of the average E. coli gene. Other classes of 'highly expressed genes' (e.g. amino acyl tRNA synthetases, chaperonins, modification genes essential to translation activities) show less extreme codon biases. Consistently for genes with experimentally determined expression rates in the exponential growth phase, those of highest molar abundances are more deviant from the average gene codon frequencies and are more similar in codon frequencies to the average ribosomal protein gene. Independent of gene size, the codon biases in the 5' third of genes deviate by more than a factor of two from those in the middle and 3' thirds. In this context, there appear to be conflicting selection pressures imposed by the constraints of ribosomal binding, or more generally the early phase of protein synthesis (about the first 50 codons) may be more biased than the complete nascent polypeptide. In partitioning the E. coli genome into 10 equal lengths, pronounced differences in codon site 3 G+C frequencies accumulate. Genes near to oriC have 5\% greater codon site 3 G+C frequencies than do genes from the ter region. This difference also is observed between small (100-300 codons) and large (>800 codons) genes. This result contrasts with that for eukaryotic genomes (including human, Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast) where long genes tend to have site 3 more AT rich than short genes. Many of the above results are special for E. coli genes and do not apply to genes of most bacterial genomes. A gene is defined as alien (possibly horizontally transferred) if its codon bias relative to the average gene exceeds a high threshold and the codon bias relative to ribosomal proteins is also appropriately high. These are identified, including four clusters (operons). The bulk of these genes have no known function.}

Four other analyses appropriate to this task are G+C genome variation (the standard method); genomic signature divergences (dinucleotide bias); extremes of codon bias; and anomalies of amino acid usage. For example, the cagA domain of Helicobacter pylori is highly deviant in its genome signature and codon bias from the rest of the genome. Using these methods we can detect two potential PAIs in the Neisseria meningitidis genome, which contain hemagglutinin and/or hemolysin-related genes. Additionally, G+C variation and genome signature differences of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome indicate two pA gene clusters.}

Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.}

To determine whether natural mRNAs exhibit biases related to local RNA secondary structure, a new randomization procedure was developed, DicodonShuffle, which randomizes mRNA sequences while preserving the same encoded protein sequence, the same codon usage, and the same dinucleotide composition as the native message. Genes from 10 of 14 eubacterial species studied and one eukaryote, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exhibited statistically significant biases in favor of local RNA structure as measured by folding free energy. Several significant associations suggest functional roles for mRNA structure, including stronger secondary structure bias in the coding regions of intron-containing yeast genes than in intronless genes, and significantly higher folding potential in polycistronic messages than in monocistronic messages in Escherichia coli. Potential secondary structure generally increased in genes from the 5' to the 3' end of E. coli operons, and secondary structure potential was conserved in homologous Salmonella typhi operons. These results are interpreted in terms of possible roles of RNA structures in RNA processing, regulation of mRNA stability, and translational control.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many methods have been described to identify regulatory motifs in the transcription control regions of genes that exhibit similar patterns of gene expression across a variety of experimental conditions. Here we focus on a single experimental condition, and utilize gene expression data to identify sequence motifs associated with genes that are activated under this experimental condition. We use a linear model with two-way interactions to model gene expression as a function of sequence features (words) present in presumptive transcription control regions. The most relevant features are selected by a feature selection method called stepwise selection with monte carlo cross validation. We apply this method to a publicly available dataset of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, focussing on the 800 basepairs immediately upstream of each gene's translation start site (the upstream control region (UCR)). RESULTS: We successfully identify regulatory motifs that are known to be active under the experimental conditions analyzed, and find additional significant sequences that may represent novel regulatory motifs. We also discuss a complementary method that utilizes gene expression data from a single microarray experiment and allows averaging over variety of experimental conditions as an alternative to motif finding methods that act on clusters of co-expressed genes.

	abstract = {A DNA microarray chip for detecting the presence of specific bacterial strains was developed using random genomic probes derived from genomic DNA, i.e., without any sequence information. Thirteen bacteria from different genuses were selected as targets. For the fabrication of the random genomic probes, genomic DNA from pure cultures of each bacterium was fractionated using several pairs of restriction endonucleases. After size fractionation of the genomic DNA fragments, random genomic libraries for each bacterium were constructed. From the library, specific probes were amplified by PCR and the probes were affixed to a slide glass to fabricate the DNA microarray chip. The results from tests with pure and mixed cultures of the bacteria used in the fabrication of the chips showed specific responses and only a small portion of cross-hybridization. This DNA microarray chip was also tested to detect the presence of specific bacteria in mixed populations. In these tests, it was demonstrated that this system provided a fast and specific response to the presence of bacterial species in mixed samples, even in activated sludge samples. This indicates that any DNA microarray chip for the detection of specific bacteria can be fabricated using the same protocols as presented in this study without requiring any genus level sequence information from pure isolates.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The development of effective environmental shotgun sequence binning methods remains an ongoing challenge in algorithmic analysis of metagenomic data. While previous methods have focused primarily on supervised learning involving extrinsic data, a first principles statistical model combined with a self-training fitting method has not yet been developed. RESULTS: We derive an unsupervised, maximum-likelihood formalism for clustering short sequences by their taxonomic origin on the basis of their k-mer distributions. The formalism is implemented using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach in a k-mer feature space. We introduce a space transformation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature space and a genomic fragment divergence measure that strongly correlates with the method's performance. Pairwise analysis of over 1000 completely sequenced genomes reveals that the vast majority of genomes have sufficient genomic fragment divergence to be amenable for binning using the present formalism. Using a high-performance implementation, the binner is able to classify fragments as short as 400 nt with accuracy over 90\% in simulations of low-complexity communities of 2 to 10 species, given sufficient genomic fragment divergence. The method is available as an open source package called LikelyBin. CONCLUSIONS: An unsupervised binning method based on statistical signatures of short environmental sequences is a viable stand-alone binning method for low complexity samples. For medium and high complexity samples, we discuss the possibility of combining the current method with other methods as part of an iterative process to enhance the resolving power of sorting reads into taxonomic and/or functional bins.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlations between genome composition (in terms of GC content) and usage of particular codons and amino acids have been widely reported, but poorly explained. We show here that a simple model of processes acting at the nucleotide level explains codon usage across a large sample of species (311 bacteria, 28 archaea and 257 eukaryotes). The model quantitatively predicts responses (slope and intercept of the regression line on genome GC content) of individual codons and amino acids to genome composition. RESULTS: Codons respond to genome composition on the basis of their GC content relative to their synonyms (explaining 71-87\% of the variance in response among the different codons, depending on measure). Amino-acid responses are determined by the mean GC content of their codons (explaining 71-79\% of the variance). Similar trends hold for genes within a genome. Position-dependent selection for error minimization explains why individual bases respond differently to directional mutation pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that GC content drives codon usage (rather than the converse). It unifies a large body of empirical evidence concerning relationships between GC content and amino-acid or codon usage in disparate systems. The relationship between GC content and codon and amino-acid usage is ahistorical; it is replicated independently in the three domains of living organisms, reinforcing the idea that genes and genomes at mutation/selection equilibrium reproduce a unique relationship between nucleic acid and protein composition. Thus, the model may be useful in predicting amino-acid or nucleotide sequences in poorly characterized taxa.}

	abstract = {To help advance the species definition for prokaryotes, we have compared the gene content of 70 closely related and fully sequenced bacterial genomes to identify whether species boundaries exist, and to determine the role of the organism's ecology on its shared gene content. We found the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the shared genes between two strains to be a robust means to compare genetic relatedness among strains, and that ANI values of approximately 94\% corresponded to the traditional 70\% DNA-DNA reassociation standard of the current species definition. At the 94\% ANI cutoff, current species includes only moderately homogeneous strains, e.g., most of the >4-Mb genomes share only 65-90\% of their genes, apparently as a result of the strains having evolved in different ecological settings. Furthermore, diagnostic genetic signatures (boundaries) are evident between groups of strains of the same species, and the intergroup genetic similarity can be as high as 98-99\% ANI, indicating that justifiable species might be found even among organisms that are nearly identical at the nucleotide level. Notably, a large fraction, e.g., up to 65\%, of the differences in gene content within species is associated with bacteriophage and transposase elements, revealing an important role of these elements during bacterial speciation. Our findings are consistent with a definition for species that would include a more homogeneous set of strains than provided by the current definition and one that considers the ecology of the strains in addition to their evolutionary distance.}

Genome sequencing has greatly facilitated the evaluation of the current taxonomic system and the development of simpler, more portable and accurate, sequence-based alternatives to substitute for the traditional cumbersome methods. Studies based on the former genome-enabled methods reveal that existing taxonomic designations, including the species level, correspond frequently to a continuum of genetic diversity as opposed to natural groupings (e.g. biological species). Improving such artificial and often ambiguous taxonomic designations, however, will require larger genomic datasets and more carefully designed sampling of natural populations. Only then can the promise for a superior genome-based taxonomy materialize.}

	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is now recognized as an important mechanism of evolution. Several methods to detect horizontally transferred genes have been suggested. These methods are based on either nucleotide composition or the failure to find a similar gene in closely related species. Genes that evolve vertically between closely related species can be divided into those that retain homologous chromosomal positions (positional orthologs) and those that do not. By comparing open reading frames in the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi genomes, we identified 2,728 positional orthologs since these species split 100 MYA. A group of 1,144 novel E. coli genes were unusually diverged from their S. typhi counterparts. These novel genes included those that had been horizontally transferred into E. coli, as well as members of gene pairs that had been rearranged or deleted. Positional orthologs were used to investigate compositional methods of identifying horizontally transferred genes. A large number of E. coli genes with normal nucleotide composition have no apparent ortholog in S. typhi, and many genes of atypical composition do, in fact, have positional orthologs. A phylogenetic approach was employed to confirm selected examples of horizontal transmission among the novel groups of genes. Our analysis of 80 E. coli genes determined that a number of genes previously classified as horizontally transferred based on base composition and codon bias were native, and genes previously classified as native appeared to be horizontally transferred. Hence, atypical nucleotide composition alone is not a reliable indicator of horizontal transmission.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: As next generation sequencing is rapidly adding new genomes, their correct placement in the taxonomy needs verification. However, the current methods for confirming classification of a taxon or suggesting revision for a potential misplacement relies on computationally intense multi-sequence alignment followed by an iterative adjustment of the distance matrix. Due to intra-heterogeneity issues with the 16S rRNA marker, no classifier is available for sub-genus level, which could readily suggest a classification for a novel 16S rRNA sequence. Metagenomics further complicates the issue by generating fragmented 16S rRNA sequences. This article proposes a novel alignment-free method for representing the microbial profiles using extensible Markov models (EMMs) with an extended Karlin-Altschul statistical framework similar to the classic alignment paradigm. We propose a log odds (LODs) score classifier based on Gumbel difference distribution that confirms correct classifications with statistical significance qualifications and suggests revisions where necessary. RESULTS: We tested our method by generating a sub-genus level classifier with which we re-evaluated classifications of 676 microbial organisms using the NCBI FTP database for the 16S rRNA. The results confirm current classification for all genera while ascertaining significance at 95\%. Furthermore, this novel classifier isolates heterogeneity issues to a mere 12 strains while confirming classifications with significance qualification for the remaining 98\%. The models require less memory than that needed by multi-sequence alignments and have better time complexity than the current methods. The classifier operates at sub-genus level, and thus outperforms the naive Bayes classifier of the RNA Database Project where much of the taxonomic analysis is available online. Finally, using information redundancy in model building, we show that the method applies to metagenomic fragment classification of 19 Escherichia coli strains.

	abstract = {ARISA (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) is a commonly used method for microbial community analysis that provides estimates of microbial richness and diversity. Here we investigated the potential biases of ARISA in richness estimation by performing computer simulations using 722 complete genomes. Our simulations based on in silico PCR demonstrated that over 8\% of bacterial strains represented by complete genomes will never yield a PCR fragment using ARISA primers, usually because their ribosomal RNA genes are not organized in an operon. Despite the tendency of ARISA to overestimate species richness, a strong linear correlation exists between the observed number of fragments, even after binning, and the actual number of species in the sample. This linearity is fairly robust to the taxon sampling in the database as it is also observed on subsets of the 722 genome database using a jackknife approach. However, this linearity disappears when the species richness is high and binned fragment lengths gradually become saturated. We suggest that for ARISA-based richness estimates, where the number of binned lengths observed ranges between 10-116, a correction should be used in order to obtain more accurate "species richness" results comparable to 16S rRNA clone library data.}

	abstract = {Metagenomics is providing striking insights into the ecology of microbial communities. The recently developed massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing technique gives the opportunity to rapidly obtain metagenomic sequences at a low cost and without cloning bias. However, the phylogenetic analysis of the short reads produced represents a significant computational challenge. The phylogenetic algorithm CARMA for predicting the source organisms of environmental 454 reads is described. The algorithm searches for conserved Pfam domain and protein families in the unassembled reads of a sample. These gene fragments (environmental gene tags, EGTs), are classified into a higher-order taxonomy based on the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree of each matching Pfam family. The method exhibits high accuracy for a wide range of taxonomic groups, and EGTs as short as 27 amino acids can be phylogenetically classified up to the rank of genus. The algorithm was applied in a comparative study of three aquatic microbial samples obtained by 454 pyrosequencing. Profound differences in the taxonomic composition of these samples could be clearly revealed.}

	abstract = {The phylogenetic structure of the microbial community residing in a fermentation sample from a production-scale biogas plant fed with maize silage, green rye and liquid manure was analysed by an integrated approach using clone library sequences and metagenome sequence data obtained by 454-pyrosequencing. Sequencing of 109 clones from a bacterial and an archaeal 16S-rDNA amplicon library revealed that the obtained nucleotide sequences are similar but not identical to 16S-rDNA database sequences derived from different anaerobic environments including digestors and bioreactors. Most of the bacterial 16S-rDNA sequences could be assigned to the phylum Firmicutes with the most abundant class Clostridia and to the class Bacteroidetes, whereas most archaeal 16S-rDNA sequences cluster close to the methanogen Methanoculleus bourgensis. Further sequences of the archaeal library most probably represent so far non-characterised species within the genus Methanoculleus. A similar result derived from phylogenetic analysis of mcrA clone sequences. The mcrA gene product encodes the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme-M reductase involved in the final step of methanogenesis. BLASTn analysis applying stringent settings resulted in assignment of 16S-rDNA metagenome sequence reads to 62 16S-rDNA amplicon sequences thus enabling frequency of abundance estimations for 16S-rDNA clone library sequences. Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier processing of metagenome 16S-rDNA reads revealed abundance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Euryarchaeota and the orders Clostridiales, Bacteroidales and Methanomicrobiales. Moreover, a large fraction of 16S-rDNA metagenome reads could not be assigned to lower taxonomic ranks, demonstrating that numerous microorganisms in the analysed fermentation sample of the biogas plant are still unclassified or unknown.}

Based on our experience at the Joint Genome Institute, we describe the chain of decisions accompanying a metagenomic project from the viewpoint of the bioinformatic analysis step by step. We guide the reader through a standard workflow for a metagenomic project beginning with presequencing considerations such as community composition and sequence data type that will greatly influence downstream analyses. We proceed with recommendations for sampling and data generation including sample and metadata collection, community profiling, construction of shotgun libraries, and sequencing strategies. We then discuss the application of generic sequence processing steps (read preprocessing, assembly, and gene prediction and annotation) to metagenomic data sets in contrast to genome projects. Different types of data analyses particular to metagenomes are then presented, including binning, dominant population analysis, and gene-centric analysis. Finally, data management issues are presented and discussed. We hope that this review will assist bioinformaticians and biologists in making better-informed decisions on their journey during a metagenomic project.}

	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the 'rare biosphere', is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli MG1655 as a reference template, we find that 16S rDNA diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of 16S pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Because bacteria do not have a robust fossil record, attempts to infer the timing of events in their evolutionary history requires comparisons of molecular sequences. This use of molecular clocks is based on the assumptions that substitution rates for homologous genes or sites are fairly constant through time and across taxa. Violation of these conditions can lead to erroneous inferences and result in estimates that are off by orders of magnitude. In this study, we examine the consistency of substitution rates among a set of conserved genes in diverse bacterial lineages, and address the questions regarding the validity of molecular dating. RESULTS: By examining the evolution of 16S rRNA gene in obligate endosymbionts, which can be calibrated by the fossil record of their hosts, we found that the rates are consistent within a clade but varied widely across different bacterial lineages. Genome-wide estimates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions suggest that these two measures are highly variable in their rates across bacterial taxa. Genetic drift plays a fundamental role in determining the accumulation of substitutions in 16S rRNA genes and at nonsynonymous sites. Moreover, divergence estimates based on a set of universally conserved protein-coding genes also exhibit low correspondence to those based on 16S rRNA genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results document a wide range of substitution rates across genes and bacterial taxa. This high level of variation cautions against the assumption of a universal molecular clock for inferring divergence times in bacteria. However, by applying relative-rate tests to homologous genes, it is possible to derive reliable local clocks that can be used to calibrate bacterial evolution.

CBS that contain amino acids with similar chemical properties can have functional and structural importance. This paper describes ProBias, a web-server that searches a protein sequence for CBS composed of user-specified amino acid types. ProBias utilizes the discrete scan statistics to estimate statistical significance of CBS and is able to detect even subtle local deviations from the random independence model. The web-server also analyzes the global compositional bias of the input sequence. In the case of novel proteins that lack functional annotation, statistically significant CBS reported by ProBias can be used to guide the search for potential functionally important sites or domains.

	abstract = {The publication of a complete genome sequence is usually accompanied by annotations of its genes. In contrast to protein coding genes, genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are often poorly or inconsistently annotated. This makes comparative studies based on rRNA genes difficult. We have therefore created computational predictors for the major rRNA species from all kingdoms of life and compiled them into a program called RNAmmer. The program uses hidden Markov models trained on data from the 5S ribosomal RNA database and the European ribosomal RNA database project. A pre-screening step makes the method fast with little loss of sensitivity, enabling the analysis of a complete bacterial genome in less than a minute. Results from running RNAmmer on a large set of genomes indicate that the location of rRNAs can be predicted with a very high level of accuracy. Novel, unannotated rRNAs are also predicted in many genomes. The software as well as the genome analysis results are available at the CBS web server.}

	abstract = {The large open reading frames of insertion sequences from Escherichia coli were examined for their spatial pattern of codon usage bias and distribution of rarely used codons. There is a bias in codon usage that is generally lower toward the terminal ends of the coding regions, which is reflected in the occurrence of an excess of nonpreferred codons in the 3' portions of the coding regions as compared with the 5' portions. In contrast, typical chromosomal genes have a lower codon usage bias toward the 5' ends of the coding regions. These results imply that the selective forces reflected in codon usage bias may differ according to position within the coding sequence. In addition, these constraints apparently differ in important ways between genes contained in insertion sequences and those in the chromosome.}

By examining homologous sequences in species of varying degrees of relatedness and of known phylogenetic relationships, we analyzed the patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions within and among these genes. Although both loci accumulate synonymous substitutions at reduced rates due to codon usage bias, portions of the gap and ompA reading frames show significant deviation in synonymous substitution rates not attributable to local codon bias. A paucity of synonymous substitutions in portions of the ompA gene may reflect selection for a novel mRNA secondary structure. In addition, these studies allow comparisons of homologous protein-coding sequences (gap) in plants, animals, and bacteria, revealing differences in evolutionary constraints on this glycolytic enzyme in these lineages.}

	abstract = {Although bacterial species display wide variation in their overall GC contents, the genes within a particular species' genome are relatively similar in base composition. As a result, sequences that are novel to a bacterial genome-i.e., DNA introduced through recent horizontal transfer-often bear unusual sequence characteristics and can be distinguished from ancestral DNA. At the time of introgression, horizontally transferred genes reflect the base composition of the donor genome; but, over time, these sequences will ameliorate to reflect the DNA composition of the new genome because the introgressed genes are subject to the same mutational processes affecting all genes in the recipient genome. This process of amelioration is evident in a large group of genes involved in host-cell invasion by enteric bacteria and can be modeled to predict the amount of time required after transfer for foreign DNA to resemble native DNA. Furthermore, models of amelioration can be used to estimate the time of introgression of foreign genes in a chromosome. Applying this approach to a 1.43-megabase continuous sequence, we have calculated that the entire Escherichia coli chromosome contains more than 600 kb of horizontally transferred, protein-coding DNA. Estimates of amelioration times indicate that this DNA has accumulated at a rate of 31 kb per million years, which is on the order of the amount of variant DNA introduced by point mutations. This rate predicts that the E. coli and Salmonella enterica lineages have each gained and lost more than 3 megabases of novel DNA since their divergence.}

	abstract = {Unlike crown eukaryotic species, microbial species are created by continual processes of gene loss and acquisition promoted by horizontal genetic transfer. The amounts of foreign DNA in bacterial genomes, and the rate at which this is acquired, are consistent with gene transfer as the primary catalyst for microbial differentiation. However, the rate of successful gene transfer varies among bacterial lineages. The heterogeneity in foreign DNA content is directly correlated with amount of genetic headroom intrinsic to a bacterial species. Genetic headroom reflects the amount of potentially dispensable information--reflected in codon usage bias and codon context bias--that can be transiently sacrificed to allow experimentation with functions introduced by gene transfer. In this way, genetic headroom offers a potential metric for assessing the propensity of a lineage to speciate.}

After extensively scanning the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, we identified the V5 hypervariable region as a short region providing reliable identification of bacterial sequences available in public databases such as the Human Oral Microbiome Database. We amplified samples from the oral cavity of three healthy individuals using primers covering an ~82-base segment of the V5 loop, and sequenced using the Illumina technology in a single orientation. We identified 135 genera or higher taxonomic ranks from the resulting 1,373,824 sequences. While the abundances of the most common phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and TM7) are largely comparable to previous studies, Bacteroidetes were less present. Potential sources for this difference include classification bias in this region of the 16S rRNA gene, human sample variation, sample preparation and primer bias. Using an Illumina sequencing approach, we achieved a much greater depth of coverage than previous oral microbiota studies, allowing us to identify several taxa not yet discovered in these types of samples, and to assess that at least 30,000 additional reads would be required to identify only one additional phylotype. The evolution of high-throughput sequencing technologies, and their subsequent improvements in read length enable the utilization of different platforms for studying communities of complex flora. Access to large amounts of data is already leading to a better representation of sample diversity at a reasonable cost.}

As most pseudogenes are recognized by sequence alignments, we use newly available genomic sequences to identify the pseudogenes in 11 genomes from 4 bacterial genera, each of which contains at least 1 human pathogen. The numbers of pseudogenes range from 27 in Staphylococcus aureus MW2 to 337 in Yersinia pestis CO92 (e.g. 1-8\% of the annotated genes in the genome). Most pseudogenes are formed by small frameshifting indels, but because stop codons are A + T-rich, the two low-G + C Gram-positive taxa (Streptococcus and Staphylococcus) have relatively high fractions of pseudogenes generated by nonsense mutations when compared with more G + C-rich genomes. Over half of the pseudogenes are produced from genes whose original functions were annotated as 'hypothetical' or 'unknown'; however, several broadly distributed genes involved in nucleotide processing, repair or replication have become pseudogenes in one of the sequenced Vibrio vulnificus genomes. Although many of our comparisons involved closely related strains with broadly overlapping gene inventories, each genome contains a largely unique set of pseudogenes, suggesting that pseudogenes are formed and eliminated relatively rapidly from most bacterial genomes.}

	abstract = {FtsK from Escherichia coli is a fast and sequence-directed DNA translocase with roles in chromosome dimer resolution, segregation, and decatenation. From the movement of single FtsK particles on defined DNA substrates and an analysis of skewed DNA sequences in bacteria, we identify GNGNAGGG, its complement, or both as a sequence motif that controls translocation directionality. GNGNAGGG is skewed so that it is predominantly on the leading strand of chromosomal replication. Translocation across this octamer from the 3' side of the G-rich strand causes FtsK to pause, turn around, and translocate in the opposite direction. Only 39 +/- 4\% of the encounters between FtsK and the octamer result in a turnaround, congruent with our optimum turnaround probability prediction of 30\%. The probability that the observed skew of GNGNAGGG within 1 megabase of dif occurred by chance in E. coli is 1.7 x 10(-57), and similarly dramatic skews are found in the five other bacterial genomes we examined. The fact that FtsK acts only in the terminus region and the octamer skew extends from origin to terminus implies that this skew is also important in other basic cellular processes that are common among bacteria. Finally, we show that the FtsK translocase is a powerful motor that is able to displace a triplex-forming oligo from a DNA substrate.}

	abstract = {We applied nucleic acid-based molecular methods, combined with estimates of biomass (ATP), pigments, and microelectrode measurements of chemical gradients, to map microbial diversity vertically on a millimeter scale in a hypersaline microbial mat from Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. To identify the constituents of the mat, small-subunit rRNA genes were amplified by PCR from community genomic DNA extracted from layers, cloned, and sequenced. Bacteria dominated the mat and displayed unexpected and unprecedented diversity. The majority (1,336) of the 1,586 bacterial 16S rRNA sequences generated were unique, representing 752 species (> or =97\% rRNA sequence identity) in 42 of the main bacterial phyla, including 15 novel candidate phyla. The diversity of the mat samples differentiated according to the chemical milieu defined by concentrations of O(2) and H(2)S. Bacteria of the phylum Chloroflexi formed the majority of the biomass by percentage of bulk rRNA and of clones in rRNA gene libraries. This result contradicts the general belief that cyanobacteria dominate these communities. Although cyanobacteria constituted a large fraction of the biomass in the upper few millimeters (>80\% of the total rRNA and photosynthetic pigments), Chloroflexi sequences were conspicuous throughout the mat. Filamentous Chloroflexi bacteria were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization within the polysaccharide sheaths of the prominent cyanobacterium Microcoleus chthonoplastes, in addition to free living in the mat. The biological complexity of the mat far exceeds that observed in other polysaccharide-rich microbial ecosystems, such as the human and mouse distal guts, and suggests that positive feedbacks exist between chemical complexity and biological diversity. The sequences determined in this study have been submitted to the GenBank database and assigned accession numbers DQ 329539 to DQ 331020, and DQ 397339 to DQ 397511.}

	abstract = {Humans have evolved intimate symbiotic relationships with a consortium of gut microbes (microbiome) and individual variations in the microbiome influence host health, may be implicated in disease etiology, and affect drug metabolism, toxicity, and efficacy. However, the molecular basis of these microbe-host interactions and the roles of individual bacterial species are obscure. We now demonstrate a"transgenomic" approach to link gut microbiome and metabolic phenotype (metabotype) variation. We have used a combination of spectroscopic, microbiomic, and multivariate statistical tools to analyze fecal and urinary samples from seven Chinese individuals (sampled twice) and to model the microbial-host metabolic connectivities. At the species level, we found structural differences in the Chinese family gut microbiomes and those reported for American volunteers, which is consistent with population microbial cometabolic differences reported in epidemiological studies. We also introduce the concept of functional metagenomics, defined as "the characterization of key functional members of the microbiome that most influence host metabolism and hence health." For example, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii population variation is associated with modulation of eight urinary metabolites of diverse structure, indicating that this species is a highly functionally active member of the microbiome, influencing numerous host pathways. Other species were identified showing different and varied metabolic interactions. Our approach for understanding the dynamic basis of host-microbiome symbiosis provides a foundation for the development of functional metagenomics as a probe of systemic effects of drugs and diet that are of relevance to personal and public health care solutions.}

This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as BLAST.}

The recent Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition yielded millions of predicted protein sequences, which significantly altered the landscape of known protein space by more than doubling its size and adding thousands of new families (Yooseph et al., 2007 PLoS Biol 5, e16). Such datasets, not only by their sheer size, but also by many other features, defy conventional analysis and annotation methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we describe an approach for rapid analysis of the sequence diversity and the internal structure of such very large datasets by advanced clustering strategies using the newly modified CD-HIT algorithm. We performed a hierarchical clustering analysis on the 17.4 million Open Reading Frames (ORFs) identified from the GOS study and found over 33 thousand large predicted protein clusters comprising nearly 6 million sequences. Twenty percent of these clusters did not match known protein families by sequence similarity search and might represent novel protein families. Distributions of the large clusters were illustrated on organism composition, functional class, and sample locations. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our clustering took about two orders of magnitude less computational effort than the similar protein family analysis of original GOS study. This approach will help to analyze other large metagenomic datasets in the future. A Web server with our clustering results and annotations of predicted protein clusters is available online at http://tools.camera.calit2.net/gos under the CAMERA project.}

	abstract = {A fundamental biological question is what forces shape the guanine plus cytosine (GC) content of genomes. We studied the specificity and rate of different mutational biases in real time in the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium under conditions of strongly reduced selection and in the absence of the major DNA repair systems involved in repairing common spontaneous mutations caused by oxidized and deaminated DNA bases. The mutational spectrum was determined by whole-genome sequencing of two S. typhimurium mutants that were serially passaged for 5,000 generations. Analysis of 943 identified base pair substitutions showed that 91\% were GC-to-TA transversions and 7\% were GC-to-AT transitions, commonly associated with 8-oxoG- and deamination-induced damages, respectively. Other types of base pair substitutions constituted the remaining 2\% of the mutations. With regard to mutational biases, there was a significant increase in C-to-T transitions on the nontranscribed strand, and for highly expressed genes, C/G-to-T mutations were more common than expected; however, no significant mutational bias with regard to leading and lagging strands of replication or chromosome position were found. These results suggest that, based on the experimentally determined mutational rates and specificities, a bacterial genome lacking the relevant DNA repair systems could, as a consequence of these underlying mutational biases, very rapidly reduce its GC content.}

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing technology allows us to characterize microbial communities using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences orders of magnitude faster and more cheaply than has previously been possible. However, results from different studies using pyrosequencing and traditional sequencing are often difficult to compare, because amplicons covering different regions of the rRNA might yield different conclusions. We used sequences from over 200 globally dispersed environments to test whether studies that used similar primers clustered together mistakenly, without regard to environment. We then tested whether primer choice affects sequence-based community analyses using UniFrac, our recently-developed method for comparing microbial communities. We performed three tests of primer effects. We tested whether different simulated amplicons generated the same UniFrac clustering results as near-full-length sequences for three recent large-scale studies of microbial communities in the mouse and human gut, and the Guerrero Negro microbial mat. We then repeated this analysis for short sequences (100-, 150-, 200- and 250-base reads) resembling those produced by pyrosequencing. The results show that sequencing effort is best focused on gathering more short sequences rather than fewer longer ones, provided that the primers are chosen wisely, and that community comparison methods such as UniFrac are surprisingly robust to variation in the region sequenced.}

	abstract = {The recent introduction of massively parallel pyrosequencers allows rapid, inexpensive analysis of microbial community composition using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. However, a major challenge is to design a workflow so that taxonomic information can be accurately and rapidly assigned to each read, so that the composition of each community can be linked back to likely ecological roles played by members of each species, genus, family or phylum. Here, we use three large 16S rRNA datasets to test whether taxonomic information based on the full-length sequences can be recaptured by short reads that simulate the pyrosequencer outputs. We find that different taxonomic assignment methods vary radically in their ability to recapture the taxonomic information in full-length 16S rRNA sequences: most methods are sensitive to the region of the 16S rRNA gene that is targeted for sequencing, but many combinations of methods and rRNA regions produce consistent and accurate results. To process large datasets of partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained from surveys of various microbial communities, including those from human body habitats, we recommend the use of Greengenes or RDP classifier with fragments of at least 250 bases, starting from one of the primers R357, R534, R798, F343 or F517.}

The first factor was correlated with the global hydrophobicity of proteins, and it discriminated integral membrane proteins from the others. The second factor was correlated with gene expressivity, showing a bias in highly expressed genes towards amino-acids having abundant major tRNAs. Just as highly expressed genes have reduced codon diversity in protein coding sequences, so do they have a reduced diversity of amino-acid choice. This showed that translational constraints are important enough to affect the global amino-acid composition of proteins. The third factor was correlated with the aromaticity of proteins, showing that aromatic amino-acid content is highly variable.}

There was a departure from intrastrand equifrequency between A and T or between C and G, showing that the substitution patterns of the two strands of DNA were asymmetric. The positions of the boundaries between these compartments were found to coincide with the origin and terminus of chromosome replication, and there were more A-T and C-G deviations in intergenic regions and third codon positions, suggesting that a mutational bias was responsible for this asymmetry. The strand asymmetry was found to be due to a difference in base compositions of transcripts in the leading and lagging strands. This difference is sufficient to affect codon usage, but it is small compared to the effects of gene expressivity and amino-acid composition.}

Observed amino-acid frequencies were compared with those expected from a neutral model assuming the absence of selection on average protein composition. Integral membrane proteins and non-integral membrane proteins were analyzed separately. The average deviation from this neutral model shows that there is a selective pressure increasing content in charged amino acids for non-integral membrane proteins, and content in hydrophobic amino acids for integral membrane proteins. Amino-acid frequencies were greatly influenced by genomic G+C content, but the influence was found to be often weaker than predicted. This may be evidence for a selective pressure, maintaining most amino-acid frequencies close to an optimal value. Concordance between the genetic code and protein composition is discussed in the light of this observation.}

When the substitution rates are not constant, the G + C equilibrium position is not constant. The DNA sequence base frequencies always tend to a state in which A = T and G = C within a strand, regardless of substitution rates. This is true even when the substitution rates are not constant over time. This provides a simple way of rejecting the model from inspection of present-day DNA base composition.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: When there are no strand-specific biases in mutation and selection rates (that is, in the substitution rates) between the two strands of DNA, the average nucleotide composition is theoretically expected to be A = T and G = C within each strand. Deviations from these equalities are therefore evidence for an asymmetry in selection and/or mutation between the two strands. By focusing on weakly selected regions that could be oriented with respect to replication in 43 out of 51 completely sequenced bacterial chromosomes, we have been able to detect asymmetric directional mutation pressures. RESULTS: Most of the 43 chromosomes were found to be relatively enriched in G over C and T over A, and slightly depleted in G+C, in their weakly selected positions (intergenic regions and third codon positions) in the leading strand compared with the lagging strand. Deviations from A = T and G = C were highly correlated between third codon positions and intergenic regions, with a lower degree of deviation in intergenic regions, and were not correlated with overall genomic G+C content. CONCLUSIONS: During the course of bacterial chromosome evolution, the effects of asymmetric directional mutation pressures are commonly observed in weakly selected positions. The degree of deviation from equality is highly variable among species, and within species is higher in third codon positions than in intergenic regions. The orientation of these effects is almost universal and is compatible in most cases with the hypothesis of an excess of cytosine deamination in the single-stranded state during DNA replication. However, the variation in G+C content between species is influenced by factors other than asymmetric mutation pressure.}

Interference between replication and gene expression plays a minor role. The situation may be different in other bacteria.

	abstract = {Starting from two datasets of codon usage in coding sequences from mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria, we used internal correspondence analysis to study the variability of codon usage within and between species, and within and between amino acids. The first dataset included 18,958,458 codons from 58,482 coding sequences from completely sequenced genomes of 25 species, along with 6,793,581 dinucleotides from 21,876 intergenic spaces. The second dataset, with partially sequenced genomes, included 97,095,873 codons from 293 bacterial species. Results were consistent between the two datasets. The trend for the amino-acid composition of thermophilic proteins was found to be under the control of a pressure at the nucleic acid level, not a selection at the protein level. This effect was not present in intergenic spaces, ruling out a pressure at the DNA level. The pattern at the mRNA level was more complex than a simple purine enrichment of the sense strand of coding sequences. Outliers in the partial genome dataset introduced a note of caution about the interpretation of temperature as the direct determinant of the trend observed in thermophiles. The surprising lack of selection on the amino-acid content of thermophilic proteins suggests that the amino-acid repertoire was set up in a hot environment.}

	abstract = {Marine microbial genomics and metagenomics is an emerging field in environmental research. Since the completion of the first marine bacterial genome in 2003, the number of fully sequenced marine bacteria has grown rapidly. Concurrently, marine metagenomics studies are performed on a regular basis, and the resulting number of sequences is growing exponentially. To address environmentally relevant questions like organismal adaptations to oceanic provinces and regional differences in the microbial cycling of nutrients, it is necessary to couple sequence data with geographical information and supplement them with contextual information like physical, chemical and biological data. Therefore, new specialized databases are needed to organize and standardize data storage as well as centralize data access and interpretation. We introduce Megx.net, a set of databases and tools that handle genomic and metagenomic sequences in their environmental contexts. Megx.net includes (i) a geographic information system to systematically store and analyse marine genomic and metagenomic data in conjunction with contextual information; (ii) an environmental genome browser with fast search functionalities; (iii) a database with precomputed analyses for selected complete genomes; and (iv) a database and tool to classify metagenomic fragments based on oligonucleotide signatures. These integrative databases and webserver will help researchers to generate a better understanding of the functioning of marine ecosystems. All resources are freely accessible at http://www.megx.net.}

However, rapid advances in the understanding of bioremediation are on the horizon. Researchers now have the ability to culture microorganisms that are important in bioremediation and can evaluate their physiology using a combination of genome-enabled experimental and modelling techniques. In addition, new environmental genomic techniques offer the possibility for similar studies on as-yet-uncultured organisms. Combining models that can predict the activity of microorganisms that are involved in bioremediation with existing geochemical and hydrological models should transform bioremediation from a largely empirical practice into a science.}

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.}

Consequently, the primary source of information about a fundamental evolutionary topic, life's diversity, is the environmental distribution of gene sequences. We report the most comprehensive analysis of the environmental distribution of bacteria to date, based on 21,752 16S rRNA sequences compiled from 111 studies of diverse physical environments. We clustered the samples based on similarities in the phylogenetic lineages that they contain and found that, surprisingly, the major environmental determinant of microbial community composition is salinity rather than extremes of temperature, pH, or other physical and chemical factors represented in our samples. We find that sediments are more phylogenetically diverse than any other environment type. Surprisingly, soil, which has high species-level diversity, has below-average phylogenetic diversity. This work provides a framework for understanding the impact of environmental factors on bacterial evolution and for the direction of future sequencing efforts to discover new lineages.}

	abstract = {Diversity measurement is important for understanding community structure and dynamics, but has been particularly challenging for microorganisms. Microbial community characterization using small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences has revealed an extensive, previously unsuspected diversity that we are only now beginning to understand, especially now that advanced sequencing technologies are producing datasets containing hundreds of thousands of sequences from hundreds of samples. Efforts to quantify microbial diversity often use taxon-based methods that ignore the fact that not all species are equally related, which can therefore obscure important patterns in the data. For example, alpha-diversity (diversity within communities) is often estimated as the number of species in a community (species richness), and beta-diversity (partitioning of diversity among communities) is often based on the number of shared species. Methods for measuring alpha- and beta-diversity that account for different levels of divergence between individuals have recently been more widely applied. These methods are more powerful than taxon-based methods because microorganisms in a community differ dramatically in sequence similarity, which also often correlates with phenotypic similarity in key features such as metabolic capabilities. Consequently, divergence-based methods are providing new insights into microbial community structure and function.}

	abstract = {Across all kingdoms of biological life, protein-coding genes exhibit unequal usage of synonymous codons. Although alternative theories abound, translational selection has been accepted as an important mechanism that shapes the patterns of codon usage in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes. Here we analyze patterns of codon usage across 74 diverse bacteriophages that infect E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and L. lactis as their primary host. We use the concept of a "genome landscape," which helps reveal non-trivial, long-range patterns in codon usage across a genome. We develop a series of randomization tests that allow us to interrogate the significance of one aspect of codon usage, such as GC content, while controlling for another aspect, such as adaptation to host-preferred codons. We find that 33 phage genomes exhibit highly non-random patterns in their GC3-content, use of host-preferred codons, or both. We show that the head and tail proteins of these phages exhibit significant bias towards host-preferred codons, relative to the non-structural phage proteins. Our results support the hypothesis of translational selection on viral genes for host-preferred codons, over a broad range of bacteriophages.}

Although it was initially designed for ribosomal RNA data, it can be used for any nucleic and amino acid sequence data as well. A central database contains processed (aligned) primary structure data. Any additional descriptive data can be stored in database fields assigned to the individual sequences or linked via local or worldwide networks. A phylogenetic tree visualized in the main window can be used for data access and visualization. The package comprises additional tools for data import and export, sequence alignment, primary and secondary structure editing, profile and filter calculation, phylogenetic analyses, specific hybridization probe design and evaluation and other components for data analysis.

Based on the index proposed in the current paper, clear patterns are observed showing the relation between the base compositional deviation at three codon positions and the genomic GC content. For AT-rich genomes, the Most Deviated Codon Position (MDCP) is the 1st codon position, while for GC-rich genomes, MDCP appears at the 2nd or 3rd codon position alternatively. According to MDCP, the CDSs of a genome can be classified into two types: typical and atypical. In AT-rich genomes the typical represent the majority and account for about 3/4 of all the CDSs. Based on the functional classification of COG database, the two types of CDSs are examined. An apparent bias of distribution is observed that the CDSs with the function of 'information processing' are more likely to present in typical type.}

However, the genome sequences of many bacteria, vertebrates and viruses showed asymmetries in base composition and gene direction. To determine the relationship of base composition skews with replication orientation, gene function, codon usage biases and phylogenetic evolution, in this paper a program called DNAskew was developed for the statistical analysis of strand asymmetry and codon composition bias in the DNA sequence. In addition, the program can also be used to predict the replication boundaries of genome sequences. The method builds on the fact that there are compositional asymmetries between the leading and the lagging strand for replication. DNAskew was written in Perl script language and implemented on the LINUX operating system. It works quickly with annotated or unannotated sequences in GBFF (GenBank flatfile) or fasta format.

One of the processes affected by the asymmetry is translocation changing the position of the coding sequence on chromosome in respect to the orientation on the leading and lagging DNA strand. When analysing sets of paralogs in 50 genomes, we found that the number of observed genes which switched their positions on DNA strand is lowest for genomes with the highest DNA asymmetry. However, the number of orthologs which changed DNA strand increases with the phylogenetic distance between the compared genomes. Nevertheless, there is a fraction of coding sequences that stay on the leading strand in all analysed genomes, whereas there are no sequences that stay always on the lagging strand. Since sequences diverge very fast after switching the DNA strand, this bias in mobility of sequences is responsible, in part, for higher divergence rates among some of coding sequences located on the lagging DNA strand.}

	abstract = {One of the common features of bacterial genomes is a strong compositional asymmetry between differently replicating DNA strands (leading and lagging). The main cause of the observed bias is the mutational pressure associated with replication. This suggests that genes translocated between differently replicating DNA strands are subjected to a higher mutational pressure, which may influence their composition and divergence rate. Analyses of groups of completely sequenced bacterial genomes have revealed that the highest divergence rate is observed for the DNA sequences that in closely related genomes are located on different DNA strands in respect to their role in replication. Paradoxically, for this group of sequences the absolute values of divergence rate are higher for closely related species than for more diverged ones. Since this effect concerns only the specific group of orthologs, there must be a specific mechanism introducing bias into the structure of chromosome by enriching the set of homologs in trans position in newly diverged species in relatively highly diverged sequences. These highly diverged sequences may be of varied nature: (1) paralogs or other fast-evolving genes under weak selection; or (2) pseudogenes that will probably be eliminated from the genome during further evolution; or (3) genes whose history after divergence is longer than the history of the genomes in which they are found. The use of these highly diverged sequences for phylogenetic analyses may influence the topology and branch length of phylogenetic trees. The changing mutational pressure may contribute to arising of genes with new functions as well.}

	abstract = {A combined genomics and in situ proteomics approach can be used to determine and classify the relatedness of organisms. The common set of proteins shared within a group of genomes is encoded by the "core" set of genes, which is increasingly recognized as a metric for parsing viral and bacterial species. These can be described by the concept of a "pan-genome", which consists of this "core" set and a "dispensable" set, i.e., genes found in one or more but not all organisms in the grouping. "CoreGenesUniqueGenes" (CGUG) is a web-based tool that determines this core set of proteins in a set of genomes as well as parses the dispensable set of unique proteins in a pair of viral or small bacterial genomes. This proteome-based methodology is validated using bacteriophages, aiding the reevaluation of current classifications of bacteriophages. The utility of CGUG in the analysis of small bacterial genomes and the annotation of hypothetical proteins is also presented.}

	abstract = {The construction of metagenomic libraries has permitted the study of microorganisms resistant to isolation and the analysis of 16S rDNA sequences has been used for over two decades to examine bacterial biodiversity. Here, we show that the analysis of random sequence reads (RSRs) instead of 16S is a suitable shortcut to estimate the biodiversity of a bacterial community from metagenomic libraries. We generated 10 010 RSRs from a metagenomic library of microorganisms found in human faecal samples. Then searched them using the program BLASTN against a prokaryotic sequence database to assign a taxon to each RSR. The results were compared with those obtained by screening and analysing the clones containing 16S rDNA sequences in the whole library. We found that the biodiversity observed by RSR analysis is consistent with that obtained by 16S rDNA. We also show that RSRs are suitable to compare the biodiversity between different metagenomic libraries. RSRs can thus provide a good estimate of the biodiversity of a metagenomic library and, as an alternative to 16S, this approach is both faster and cheaper.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Do species use codons that reduce the impact of errors in translation or replication? The genetic code is arranged in a way that minimizes errors, defined as the sum of the differences in amino-acid properties caused by single-base changes from each codon to each other codon. However, the extent to which organisms optimize the genetic messages written in this code has been far less studied. We tested whether codon and amino-acid usages from 457 bacteria, 264 eukaryotes, and 33 archaea minimize errors compared to random usages, and whether changes in genome G+C content influence these error values. RESULTS: We tested the hypotheses that organisms choose their codon usage to minimize errors, and that the large observed variation in G+C content in coding sequences, but the low variation in G+U or G+A content, is due to differences in the effects of variation along these axes on the error value. Surprisingly, the biological distribution of error values has far lower variance than randomized error values, but error values of actual codon and amino-acid usages are actually greater than would be expected by chance. CONCLUSION: These unexpected findings suggest that selection against translation error has not produced codon or amino-acid usages that minimize the effects of errors, and that even messages with very different nucleotide compositions somehow maintain a relatively constant error value. They raise the question: why do all known organisms use highly error-minimizing genetic codes, but fail to minimize the errors in the mRNA messages they encode?}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern high-throughput sequencing technologies enable the simultaneous analysis of organisms in an environment. The analysis of species diversity and the binning of DNA fragments of non-sequenced species for assembly are two major challenges in sequence analysis. To achieve reasonable binnings and classifications, DNA fragment structure has to be represented appropriately, so it can be processed by machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: Hierarchically growing hyperbolic Self-Organizing maps (H(2)SOMs) are trained to cluster small variable-length DNA fragments (0.2-50 kb) of 350 prokaryotic organisms at six taxonomic ranks Superkingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Genus and Species in the Tree of Life. DNA fragments are mapped to three different types of feature vectors based on the genomic signature: basic features, features considering the importance of oligonucleotide patterns as well as contrast enhanced features. The H (2)SOM classifier achieves high classification rates while at the same time its visualization allows further insights into the projected data and has the potential to support binning of short sequence reads, because DNA fragments can be grouped into phylogenetic groups. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the H(2)HSOM classifier in Matlab is provided at www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/ags/ani/projects/HHSOMSeqData.}

To evaluate methods presently used to process metagenomic sequences, we constructed three simulated data sets of varying complexity by combining sequencing reads randomly selected from 113 isolate genomes. These data sets were designed to model real metagenomes in terms of complexity and phylogenetic composition. We assembled sampled reads using three commonly used genome assemblers (Phrap, Arachne and JAZZ), and predicted genes using two popular gene-finding pipelines (fgenesb and CRITICA/GLIMMER). The phylogenetic origins of the assembled contigs were predicted using one sequence similarity-based (blast hit distribution) and two sequence composition-based (PhyloPythia, oligonucleotide frequencies) binning methods. We explored the effects of the simulated community structure and method combinations on the fidelity of each processing step by comparison to the corresponding isolate genomes. The simulated data sets are available online to facilitate standardized benchmarking of tools for metagenomic analysis.}

Except for very simple communities, the encountered diversity has made fragment assembly and the subsequent analysis a challenging problem. A taxonomic characterization of metagenomic fragments is required for a deeper understanding of shotgun-sequenced microbial communities, but success has mostly been limited to sequences containing phylogenetic marker genes. Here we present PhyloPythia, a composition-based classifier that combines higher-level generic clades from a set of 340 completed genomes with sample-derived population models. Extensive analyses on synthetic and real metagenome data sets showed that PhyloPythia allows the accurate classification of most sequence fragments across all considered taxonomic ranks, even for unknown organisms. The method requires no more than 100 kb of training sequence for the creation of accurate models of sample-specific populations and can assign fragments >or=1 kb with high specificity.}

	abstract = {Amplicon length heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR) was investigated for its ability to distinguish between microbial community patterns from the same soil type under different land management practices. Natural sagebrush and irrigated mouldboard-ploughed soils from Idaho were queried as to which hypervariable domains, or combinations of 16S rRNA gene domains, were the best molecular markers. Using standard ecological indices to measure richness, diversity and evenness, the combination of three domains, V1, V3 and V1+V2, or the combined V1 and V3 domains were the markers that could best distinguish the undisturbed natural sagebrush communities from the mouldboard-ploughed microbial communities. Bray-Curtis similarity and multidimensional scaling were found to be better metrics to ordinate and cluster the LH-PCR community profiling data. The use/misuse of traditional ecological indices such as diversity and evenness to study microbial community profiles will remain a major point to consider when performing metagenomic studies.}

	abstract = {Previous comparison of a relatively small set of homologous genes from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium revealed that genes nearer to the origin of replication had substitution rates lower than genes closer to the replication terminus. The recently completed sequences of numerous bacterial genomes have allowed us to test whether this effect of distance from the replication origin on substitution rates, as observed for the E. coli-S. typhimurium comparison, is a general feature of bacterial genomes. Extending the analysis to all 3,000 E. coli-S. typhimurium homologs confirmed the significant association between chromosomal position and synonymous site divergence. However, the effect, though still significant, is not as dramatic as originally thought. A similar association between relative chromosomal location and synonymous substitution rate was detected in the majority of other bacterial species comparisons within alpha- and gamma- Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes but was absent in Chlamydiales. The opposite trend, i.e., a decrease in synonymous divergence with distance from the replication origin, was detected in Mycobacteria. Analysis of the patterns of nucleotide substitutions revealed that the distance effect is not affected by gene orientation and is mainly caused by an increase in rates of transversions, suggesting that this effect may not be caused by recombinational repair or biased gene conversion, as originally suggested.}

	abstract = {To investigate the dependence of the number of regulatory sites per intergenic region on genome size, we developed a new method for detecting purifying selection at noncoding positions in clades of related bacterial genomes. We comprehensively quantified evidence of purifying selection at noncoding positions across bacteria and found several striking universal patterns. Consistent with selection acting at transcriptional regulatory elements near the transcription start, we find a universal positional profile of selection with respect to gene starts and ends, showing most evidence of selection immediately upstream and least immediately downstream from genes. A further set of universal features indicates that selection for translation initiation efficiency is the major determinant of the sequence composition around translation start in all clades. In addition to a peak in selection at ribosomal binding sites, the region immediately around translation start shows a universal pattern of high adenine frequency, significant selection at silent positions, and avoidance of RNA secondary structure. Surprisingly, although the number of transcription factors (TF) increases quadratically with genome size, we present several lines of evidence that small and large genomes have the same average number of regulatory sites per intergenic region. By comparing the sequence diversity of the most and least conserved DNA words in intergenic regions across clades we provide evidence that the structure of transcription regulatory networks changes dramatically with genome size: Small genomes have a small number of TFs with a large number of target sites, whereas large genomes have a large number of TFs with a small number of target sites each.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: DNA viruses have a wide range of genome sizes (5 kb up to 1.2 Mb, compared to 0.16 Mb to 1.5 Mb for obligate parasitic bacteria) that do not correlate with their virulence or the taxonomic distribution of their hosts. The reasons for such large variation are unclear. According to the traditional view of viruses as gifted "gene pickpockets", large viral genome sizes could originate from numerous gene acquisitions from their hosts. We investigated this hypothesis by studying 67 large DNA viruses with genome sizes larger than 150 kb, including the recently characterized giant mimivirus. Given that horizontally transferred DNA often have anomalous nucleotide compositions differing from the rest of the genome, we conducted a detailed analysis of the inter- and intra-genome compositional properties of these viruses. We then interpreted their compositional heterogeneity in terms of possible causes, including strand asymmetry, gene function/expression, and horizontal transfer. RESULTS: We first show that the global nucleotide composition and nucleotide word usage of viral genomes are species-specific and distinct from those of their hosts. Next, we identified compositionally anomalous (cA) genes in viral genomes, using a method based on Bayesian inference. The proportion of cA genes is highly variable across viruses and does not exhibit a significant correlation with genome size. The vast majority of the cA genes were of unknown function, lacking homologs in the databases. For genes with known homologs, we found a substantial enrichment of cA genes in specific functional classes for some of the viruses. No significant association was found between cA genes and compositional strand asymmetry. A possible exogenous origin for a small fraction of the cA genes could be confirmed by phylogenetic reconstruction. CONCLUSION: At odds with the traditional dogma, our results argue against frequent genetic transfers to large DNA viruses from their modern hosts. The large genome sizes of these viruses are not simply explained by an increased propensity to acquire foreign genes. This study also confirms that the anomalous nucleotide compositions of the cA genes is sometimes linked to particular biological functions or expression patterns, possibly leading to an overestimation of recent horizontal gene transfers.}

	abstract = {Most terrestrial carbon sequestration at mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere occurs in seasonal, montane forest ecosystems. Winter respiratory carbon dioxide losses from these ecosystems are high, and over half of the carbon assimilated by photosynthesis in the summer can be lost the following winter. The amount of winter carbon dioxide loss is potentially susceptible to changes in the depth of the snowpack; a shallower snowpack has less insulation potential, causing colder soil temperatures and potentially lower soil respiration rates. Recent climate analyses have shown widespread declines in the winter snowpack of mountain ecosystems in the western USA and Europe that are coupled to positive temperature anomalies. Here we study the effect of changes in snow cover on soil carbon cycling within the context of natural climate variation. We use a six-year record of net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange in a subalpine forest to show that years with a reduced winter snowpack are accompanied by significantly lower rates of soil respiration. Furthermore, we show that the cause of the high sensitivity of soil respiration rate to changes in snow depth is a unique soil microbial community that exhibits exponential growth and high rates of substrate utilization at the cold temperatures that exist beneath the snow. Our observations suggest that a warmer climate may change soil carbon sequestration rates in forest ecosystems owing to changes in the depth of the insulating snow cover.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: One of the first steps in metagenomic analysis is the assignment of reads/contigs obtained from various sequencing technologies to their correct taxonomic bins. Similarity based binning methods assign a read to a taxon/clade based on the pattern of significant BLAST hit(s) generated against sequence databases. Existing methods which use bit-score as the sole parameter to ascertain the significance of BLAST hits have limited specificity and accuracy of binning. A new binning algorithm, called SOrt-ITEMS is introduced which addresses these limitations. The method uses alignment parameters besides the bit score to first identify an appropriate taxonomic level where the read can be assigned. An orthology based approach is subsequently used by the method for the final assignment. RESULTS: The performance of SOrt-ITEMS has been validated with reads simulating sequences from 454 and Sanger sequencing technologies. In addition, the taxonomic composition of the Sargasso Sea data set has been analyzed using SOrt-ITEMS. SOrt-ITEMS shows improved specificity and accuracy of assignments especially in simulated scenarios, wherein sequences corresponding to the source organism of the reads are absent in the reference database.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many bacterial chromosomes display nucleotide asymmetry, or skew, between the leading and lagging strands of replication. Mutational differences between these strands result in an overall pattern of skew that is centered about the origin of replication. Such a pattern could also arise from selection coupled with a bias for genes coded on the leading strand. The relative contributions of selection and mutation in producing compositional skew are largely unknown. RESULTS: We describe a model to quantify the contribution of mutational differences between the leading and lagging strands in producing replication-induced skew. When the origin and terminus of replication are known, the model can be used to estimate the relative accumulation of G over C and of A over T on the leading strand due to replication effects in a chromosome with bidirectional replication arms. The model may also be implemented in a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the locations of origin and terminus. We find that our estimations for the origin and terminus agree very well with the location of genes that are thought to be associated with the replication origin. This indicates that our model provides an accurate, objective method of determining the replication arms and also provides support for the hypothesis that these genes represent an ancestral cluster of origin-associated genes. CONCLUSION: The model has several advantages over other methods of analyzing genome skew. First, it quantifies the role of mutation in generating skew so that its effect on composition, for example codon bias, can be assessed. Second, it provides an objective method for locating origin and terminus, one that is based on chromosome-wide accumulation of leading vs lagging strand nucleotide differences. Finally, the model has the potential to be utilized in a maximum likelihood framework in order to analyze the effect of chromosome rearrangements on nucleotide composition.}

We first try to define, for each species, the neutral expected codon usage to better approach subsequently the influence of selection. Overlapping triplets counted from the complete DNA genomic sequence and mean amino acid composition of ORFs allow us to build satisfying expected codon usage for each species. Within species deviation from this neutral model is then studied through Correspondence Analysis and characterization with bias index, N(C)' (effective number of codons reported to neutral model). Our results are compared to previously published ones for three species and let appear good agreement in spite of very different methods. We thus propose set of codons probably preferred by selection for nine other species. In the four last species, no clear preference can be evidenced. Finally, we characterize variation of codon usage over functional categories. We propose that the high degree of bias of proteins involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis has a positive influence on overexpression of the corresponding genes under optimum growth conditions and is a negative regulator of the same genes when amino acids become limited resources.}

	abstract = {PCR was used to amplify (eu)bacterial small-subunit (16S) rRNA genes from total-community genomic DNA. The source of total-community genomic DNA used for this culture-independent analysis was the microbial mats from a deep-sea, hydrothermal vent system, Pele's Vents, located at Loihi Seamount, Hawaii. Oligonucleotides complementary to conserved regions in the 16S rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) of bacteria were used to direct the synthesis of PCR products, which were then subcloned by blunt-end ligation into phagemid vector pBluescript II. Restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, created by using tandem tetrameric restriction endonucleases, revealed the presence of 12 groups of 16S rRNA genes representing discrete operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The rank order abundance of these putative OTUs was measured, and the two most abundant OTUs accounted for 72.9\% of all of the 16S rDNA clones. Among the remaining 27.1\% of the 16S rDNA clones, none of the 10 OTUs was represented by more than three individual clones. The cumulative OTU distribution for 48 bacterial 16S rDNA clones demonstrated that the majority of taxa represented in the clone library were detected, a result which we assume to be an estimate of the diversity of bacteria in the native hydrothermal vent habitat. 16S rDNA fingerprinting of individual clones belonging to particular OTUs by using an oligonucleotide probe that binds to a universally conserved region of the 16S rDNA fragments was conducted to confirm OTU specificity and 16S rDNA identity.}

Strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. A strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in beta-type but not alpha- or gamma-type human herpesviruses featuring G > C downstream of oriL and C > G upstream of oriL. Dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. Strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single or context-dependent base mutational rates. The absence of strand asymmetry in the archaeal genomes may reflect the presence of multiple origins of replication.}

This method is suitable for identifying alien (e.g., horizontally transferred) and highly expressed genes. In yeast and several bacterial genomes, highly expressed genes typically include ribosomal protein genes, elongation factors, chaperonins (heat shock proteins), and a subset of genes involved in glycolysis generally essential in exponential growth. Highly expressed genes of the Synechocystis genome feature several photosystem II genes, and highly expressed genes in several methanogens (Methanococcus jannaschii, M. thermoautotrophicum) are essential for methanogenesis. Alien genes mostly consist of ORFs of unknown function, transposases, prophage genes, and restriction/modification enzymes. Notably, nuclear ribosomal proteins of yeast are highly expressed, whereas mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes appear to be alien genes. Alien genes often occur in clusters, suggesting in these cases that transfer events entail several genes.}

The character and extent of frequent words are strikingly different among these genomes. The frequent words of S.pneumoniae split into three categories: parts of the previously characterized RUP and BOX repetitive elements and a 24 bp tandem repeat in the gene SP1772. The most abundant frequent words of L.lactis are all related to the 13 bp motif, WWNTTACTGACRR or its inverted complement YYGTCAGTAANWW. Distributional analysis of this motif, which we called highly repetitive motif (HRM), indicates its possible dual role. Frequent occurrences immediately downstream of genes suggest a possible role in transcription termination whereas spacings of consecutive HRMs consistent with the DNA helical period are indicative of a protein-binding site. Two regions of the L.lactis genome feature an intriguing pattern of several periodically occurring HRMs separated by precisely 59 bp. In a striking contrast to S.pneumoniae and L.lactis, S.pyogenes contains hardly any frequent words.}

	abstract = {The concept of genome signature allows sequence comparisons without alignment. It relies on the premise that oligonucleotide compositions of DNA segments from the same or closely related genomes tend to be more similar than those from distantly related genomes. This concept has been used in detection of lateral gene transfer, phylogenetic classification of metagenome sequences (binning), and in studies of evolution of viruses and plasmids. The goal of this work is to explore limitations of genome signature in phylogenetic classification of DNA sequences, and to identify formal representations of genome signature that expose best the phylogenetic relationships among prokaryotes. We found that genome signatures that best represent phylogenetic relationships are those normalized to factor out differences in G+C content and utilizing the standard A-C-G-T alphabet or the degenerate R-Y (purine-pyrimidine) alphabet. The main limitation of all genome signature representations tested is lack of divergence among some distantly related species. "Crowding" of the genome signature space and absence of molecular clock likely contribute to this phenomenon. We introduce "periodicity signatures" - formal representations of periodic sequence patterns related to DNA curvature - which can discriminate between bacterial and archaeal DNA sequences. Interestingly, archaea of the order Halobacteriaceae have periodic signatures similar to bacteria, possibly due to their early divergence from other archaea, extensive lateral gene transfer, or due to their adaptation to high salt environments. Our results have practical implications for development and application of genome signature-based methods for analysis and classification of DNA sequences.}

	abstract = {This article deals with the relationship between vocabulary (total number of distinct oligomers or "words") and text-length (total number of oligomers or "words") for a coding DNA sequence (CDS). For natural human languages, Heaps established a mathematical formula known as Heaps' law, which relates vocabulary to text-length. Our analysis shows that Heaps' law fails to model this relationship for CDSs. Here we develop a mathematical model to establish the relationship between the number of type of words (vocabulary) and the number of words sampled (text-length) for CDSs, when non-overlapping nucleotide strings with the same length are treated as words. We use tangent-hyperbolic function, which captures the saturation property of vocabulary. Based on the parameters of the model, we formulate a mathematical equation, known as "equation of word organization", whose parameters essentially indicate that nucleotide organization of coding sequences are different from one another. We also compare the word organization of CDSs with the random word distribution and conclude that a CDS is neither similar to a natural human language nor to a random one. Moreover, these sequences have their unique nucleotide organization and it is completely structured for specific biological functioning.}

Our results were disputed, but these criticisms were demonstrated to be mistaken and based on misconceptions. In a recent report, Wang et al. [H.C. Wang, E. Susko, A.J. Roger, On the correlation between genomic G+C content and optimal growth temperature in prokaryotes: data quality and confounding factors, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 342 (2006) 681-684] criticize our results by stating that "all previous simple correlation analyses of GC versus temperature have ignored the fact that genomic GC content is influenced by multiple factors including both intrinsic mutational bias and extrinsic environmental factors". This statement, besides being erroneous, is surprising because it applies in fact not to ours but to the authors' article. Here, we rebut the points raised by Wang et al. and review some issues that have been a matter of debate, regarding the influence of environmental factors upon GC content in prokaryotes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relationship that exists between genome size and GC level is valid for aerobic, facultative, and microaerophilic species, but not for anaerobic prokaryotes.}

The dinucleotide composition was significantly different between the organisms. The distribution of genes from an organism was clustered around its center in the dinucleotide composition space. The genes from closely related organisms such as Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma species and eukaryotes showed some overlap in the space. The genes from nine complete genomes together with those from human were discriminated into respective clusters with 80\% accuracy using the dinucleotide composition alone. The composition data estimated from a whole genome was close to that obtained from genes, indicating that the characteristic feature of dinucleotides holds not only for protein coding regions but also noncoding regions. When a dendrogram was constructed from the disposition of the clusters in the dinucleotide space, it resembled the real phylogenetic tree. Thus, the distinct feature observed in the dinucleotide composition may reflect the phylogenetic relationship of organisms.}

We analyzed 14,115 partial ( approximately 500 bp) 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences from saliva samples from 120 healthy individuals (10 individuals from each of 12 worldwide locations). These sequences could be assigned to 101 known bacterial genera, of which 39 were not previously reported from the human oral cavity; phylogenetic analysis suggests that an additional 64 unknown genera are present. There is high diversity in the salivary microbiome within and between individuals, but little geographic structure. Overall, approximately 13.5\% of the total variance in the composition of genera is due to differences among individuals, which is remarkably similar to the fraction of the total variance in neutral genetic markers that can be attributed to differences among human populations. Investigation of some environmental variables revealed a significant association between the genetic distances among locations and the distance of each location from the equator. Further characterization of the enormous diversity revealed here in the human salivary microbiome will aid in elucidating the role it plays in human health and disease, and in the identification of potentially informative species for studies of human population history.}

We find that the nucleoid protein H-NS selectively silences horizontally-acquired genes by targeting sequences with GC content lower than the resident genome. Mutations in hns are lethal in Salmonella unless accompanied by compensatory mutations in other regulatory loci. Thus H-NS provides a novel mechanism of bacterial defense against foreign DNA, enabling the acquisition of DNA from exogenous sources while avoiding detrimental consequences from unregulated expression of newly acquired genes. Characteristic GC/AT ratios of bacterial genomes may facilitate discrimination between "self" and foreign DNA.}

We present a novel approach for decomposing a hierarchical clustering into the clusters that optimally match a set of known annotations, as measured by the variation of information metric. Our approach is general and does not require the user to enter the number of clusters desired. We apply it to two biological domains: finding protein complexes within protein interaction networks and identifying species within metagenomic DNA samples. For these two applications, we test the quality of our clusters by using them to predict complex and species membership, respectively. We find that our approach generally outperforms the commonly used heuristic methods.}

	abstract = {This paper reports the existence of a significant negative correlation between GC12 and GC3 in the recently sequenced genome of Leishmania major. This result contradicts the previous evidence that the compositional correlations between codon positions are universal. Moreover, it challenges the interpretation of the GC12 vs. GC3 linear regression slope as the relative neutrality of GC12, within the framework of the directional mutation pressure theory [Sueoka, N., 1988. Directional mutational pressure and neutral molecular evolution. P Natl Acad Sci USA 85, 2653-2657.]. The analysis of the codon usage pattern for L. major shows that codon choice is most likely influenced by both mutation pressure and translational selection. Dinucleotide frequencies were also analysed; our results do not support the existence of an unusual neighbour-dependent mutation bias in this genome. We developed two evolutionary models that could explain the origin of the negative GC12/GC3 correlation. The first model is based on the effect of translational selection on the GC3 the second one is based on a potential mutation bias combined with purifying selection at the amino-acid level. Both models predict a negative GC12/GC3 correlation at the equilibrium. The potential implications of these results for this aspect of the directional mutation pressure theory are discussed. We conclude that the particular case of L. major should lead to a careful reevaluation of several hypotheses of this theory. The origin of the negative GC12/GC3 correlation remains for now an open question.}

	abstract = {DNA base composition asymmetry is at the basis of numerous in silico methods for the detection of the origin and terminus of replication in prokaryotes. However, most of these methods are unable to identify the evolutionary mechanisms that cause the base composition asymmetry. In prokaryotic chromosomes, due to the tendency for coorientation between replication and transcription, compositional biases that discriminate the leading strand from the lagging strand can be produced by 2 superposing mechanisms: replication-associated mutation bias and coding sequence-associated bias (such as transcription-related mutational processes or selective pressures on codon usage). We propose here a new method for the analysis of nucleotide composition asymmetry that allows the decoupling of replication-related and coding sequence-related mechanisms. This method is inspired by a recent work (Nikolaou and Almirantis 2005) that proposed an artificial chromosomal rearrangement meant to create a perfect gene orientation bias. We show that the study of nucleotide skews on the artificially rearranged chromosomes is a powerful means to assess the contributions of the 2 types of mechanisms in generating the base composition asymmetry. We applied our method to all completely sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes available. Our results confirm that in most species the replication mechanism has an important effect on base composition asymmetry but also that it has different impacts on GC and AT skews. We also analyzed the variability in AT skew direction encountered in prokaryotes. In disagreement with a recent report (Worning et al. 2006), we find that the polymerase-alpha subunits encoded in a genome are not sufficient to predict the sign of the AT skew on its leading strand for replication.}

	abstract = {A computational strategy for determining the variability of long DNA sequences in microbial genomes is described. Composite portraits of bacterial genomes were obtained by computing tetranucleotide frequencies of sections of genomic DNA, converting the frequencies to color images and arranging the images according to their genetic position. The resulting images revealed that the tetranucleotide frequencies of genomic DNA sequences are highly conserved. Sections that were visibly different from those of the rest of the genome contained ribosomal RNA, bacteriophage, or undefined coding regions and had corresponding differences in the variances of tetranucleotide frequencies and GC content. Comparison of nine completely sequenced bacterial genomes showed that there was a nonlinear relationship between variances of the tetranucleotide frequencies and GC content, with the highest variances occurring in DNA sequences with low GC contents (less than 0.30 mol). High variances were also observed in DNA sequences having high GC contents (greater than 0.60 mol), but to a much lesser extent than DNA sequences having low GC contents. Differences in the tetranucleotide frequencies may be due to the mechanisms of intercellular genetic exchange and/or processes involved in maintaining intracellular genetic stability. Identification of sections that were different from those of the rest of the genome may provide information on the evolution and plasticity of bacterial genomes.}

	abstract = {Microbial ecology has undergone a profound change in the last two decades with regard to methods employed for the analysis of natural communities. Emphasis has shifted from culturing to the analysis of signature molecules including molecular DNA-based approaches that rely either on direct cloning and sequencing of DNA fragments (shotgun cloning) or often rely on prior amplification of target sequences by use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The pool of PCR products can again be either cloned and sequenced or can be subjected to an increasing variety of genetic profiling methods, including amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, single strand conformation polymorphism, and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. In this document, we present and critically compare these methods commonly used for the study of microbial diversity.}

	abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that metal-reducing microorganisms can effectively promote the precipitation and removal of uranium from contaminated groundwater. Microbial communities were stimulated in the acidic subsurface by pH neutralization and addition of an electron donor to wells. In single-well push-pull tests at a number of treated sites, nitrate, Fe(III), and uranium were extensively reduced and electron donors (glucose, ethanol) were consumed. Examination of sediment chemistry in cores sampled immediately adjacent to treated wells 3.5 months after treatment revealed that sediment pH increased substantially (by 1 to 2 pH units) while nitrate was largely depleted. A large diversity of 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from subsurface sediments, including species from the alpha, beta, delta, and gamma subdivisions of the class Proteobacteria, as well as low- and high-G+C gram-positive species. Following in situ biostimulation of microbial communities within contaminated sediments, sequences related to previously cultured metal-reducing delta-Proteobacteria increased from 5\% to nearly 40\% of the clone libraries. Quantitative PCR revealed that Geobacter-type 16S rRNA gene sequences increased in biostimulated sediments by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude at two of the four sites tested. Evidence from the quantitative PCR analysis corroborated information obtained from 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, indicating that members of the delta-Proteobacteria subdivision, including Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans-related and Geobacter-related sequences, are important metal-reducing organisms in acidic subsurface sediments. This study provides the first cultivation-independent analysis of the change in metal-reducing microbial communities in subsurface sediments during an in situ bioremediation experiment.}

	abstract = {Even in lieu of a dependable species concept for asexual organisms, the classification of bacteria into discrete taxonomic units is considered to be obstructed by the potential for lateral gene transfer (LGT) among lineages at virtually all phylogenetic levels. In most bacterial genomes, large proportions of genes are introduced by LGT, as indicated by their compositional features and/or phylogenetic distributions, and there is also clear evidence of LGT between very distantly related organisms. By adopting a whole-genome approach, which examined the history of every gene in numerous bacterial genomes, we show that LGT does not hamper phylogenetic reconstruction at many of the shallower taxonomic levels. Despite the high levels of gene acquisition, the only taxonomic group for which appreciable amounts of homologous recombination were detected was within bacterial species. Taken as a whole, the results derived from the analysis of complete gene inventories support several of the current means to recognize and define bacterial species.}

	abstract = {Over three decades of molecular-phylogenetic studies, researchers have compiled an increasingly robust map of evolutionary diversification showing that the main diversity of life is microbial, distributed among three primary relatedness groups or domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya. The general properties of representatives of the three domains indicate that the earliest life was based on inorganic nutrition and that photosynthesis and use of organic compounds for carbon and energy metabolism came comparatively later. The application of molecular-phylogenetic methods to study natural microbial ecosystems without the traditional requirement for cultivation has resulted in the discovery of many unexpected evolutionary lineages; members of some of these lineages are only distantly related to known organisms but are sufficiently abundant that they are likely to have impact on the chemistry of the biosphere.}

	abstract = {The paper presents a novel, n-gram-based method for analysis of bacterial genome segments known as genomic islands (GIs). Identification of GIs in bacterial genomes is an important task since many of them represent inserts that may contribute to bacterial evolution and pathogenesis. In order to characterize and distinguish GIs from rest of the genome, binary classification of islands based on n-gram frequency distribution have been performed. It consists of testing the agreement of islands n-gram frequency distributions with the complete genome and backbone sequence. In addition, a statistic based on the maximal order Markov model is used to identify significantly overrepresented and underrepresented n-grams in islands. The results may be used as a basis for Zipf-like analysis suggesting that some of the n-grams are overrepresented in a subset of islands and underrepresented in the backbone, or vice versa, thus complementing the binary classification. The method is applied to strain-specific regions in the Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 genome (O-islands), resulting in two groups of O-islands with different n-gram characteristics. It refines a characterization based on other compositional features such as G+C content and codon usage, and may help in identification of GIs, and also in research and development of adequate drugs targeting virulence genes in them.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a new ordination method to compare several communities containing species that differ according to their taxonomic, morphological or biological features. The objective is first to find dissimilarities among communities from the knowledge about differences among their species, and second to describe these dissimilarities with regard to the feature diversity within communities. In 1986, Rao initiated a general framework for analysing the extent of the diversity. He defined a diversity coefficient called quadratic entropy and a dissimilarity coefficient and proposed a decomposition of this diversity coefficient in a way similar to ANOVA. Furthermore, Gower and Legendre (1986) built a weighted principal coordinate analysis. Using the previous context, we propose a new method called the double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA) to analyse the relation between two kinds of data. The first contains differences among species (dissimilarity matrix); the second the species distribution among communities (abundance or presence/absence matrix). A multidimensional space assembling the species points and the community points is built. The species points define the original differences between species and the community points define the deduced differences between communities. Furthermore, this multidimensional space is linked with the diversity decomposition into between-community and within-community diversities. One looks for axes that provide a graphical ordination of the communities and project the species onto them. An illustration is proposed comparing bird communities which live in different areas under mediterranean bioclimates. Compared to some existing methods, the double principal coordinate analysis can provide a typology of communities taking account of an abundance matrix and can include dissimilarities among species. Finally, we show that such an approach generalizes some of these methods and allows us to develop new analyses.}

Here we describe the use of these devices to monitor the groundwater microbial community dynamics during field bioremediation experiments at the U.S. Department of Energy Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research Program's Field Research Center at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. During the 6-week deployment, microbial biofilms colonized glass wool and bead internal surfaces. Changes in viable biomass, community composition, metabolic status, and respiratory state were reflected in sampler composition, type of donor, and groundwater pH. Biofilms that formed on Bio-Sep beads had 2-13 times greater viable biomass; however, the bead communities were less metabolically active [higher cyclopropane/monoenoic phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) ratios] and had a lower aerobic respiratory state (lower total respiratory quinone/ PLFA ratio and ubiquinone/menaquinone ratio) than the biofilms formed on glass wool. Anaerobic growth in these systems was characterized by plasmalogen phospholipids and was greater in the wells that received electron donor additions. Partial 16S rDNA sequences indicated that Geobacter and nitrate-reducing organisms were induced by the acetate, ethanol, or glucose additions. DNA and lipid biomarkers were extracted and recovered without the complications that commonly plague sediment samples due to the presence of clay or dissolved organic matter. Although microbial community composition in the groundwater or adjacent sediments may differ from those formed on down-well biofilm samplers, the metabolic activity responses of the biofilms to modifications in groundwater geochemistry record the responses of the microbial community to biostimulation while providing integrative sampling and ease of recovery for biomarker analysis.}

	abstract = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.}

	abstract = {It is well known that patterns of nucleotide composition vary within and among genomes, although the reasons why these variations exist are not completely understood. Between-genome compositional variation has been exploited to assign environmental shotgun sequences to their most likely originating genomes, whereas within-genome variation has been used to identify recently acquired genetic material such as pathogenicity islands. Recent sequence assignment techniques have achieved high levels of accuracy on artificial data sets, but the relative difficulty of distinguishing lineages with varying degrees of relatedness, and different types of genomic sequence, has not been examined in depth. We investigated the compositional differences in a set of 774 sequenced microbial genomes, finding rapid divergence among closely related genomes, but also convergence of compositional patterns among genomes with similar habitats. Support vector machines were then used to distinguish all pairs of genomes based on genome fragments 500 nucleotides in length. The nearly 300,000 accuracy scores obtained from these trials were used to construct general models of distinguishability versus taxonomic and compositional indices of genomic divergence. Unusual genome pairs were evident from their large residuals relative to the fitted model, and we identified several factors including genome reduction, putative lateral genetic transfer, and habitat convergence that influence the distinguishability of genomes. The positional, compositional, and functional context of a fragment within a genome has a strong influence on its likelihood of correct classification, but in a way that depends on the taxonomic and ecological similarity of the comparator genome.}

CONTENT: This review describes evolving strategies in metagenomics, with a special emphasis on the core technology of DNA pyrosequencing. The challenges of microbial identification in the context of microbial populations are discussed. The development of next-generation pyrosequencing strategies and the technical hurdles confronting these methodologies are addressed. Bioinformatics-related topics include taxonomic systems, sequence databases, sequence-alignment tools, and classifiers. DNA sequencing based on 16S rRNA genes or entire genomes is summarized with respect to potential pyrosequencing applications. SUMMARY: Both the approach of 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and the whole-genome sequencing approach may be useful for human metagenomics, and numerous bioinformatics tools are being deployed to tackle such vast amounts of microbiological sequence diversity. Metagenomics, or genetic studies of microbial communities, may ultimately contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of human health, disease susceptibilities, and the pathophysiology of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.}

Our set of protein-coding genes is supported by extensive proteomic and sequence homology data. The structures of the plasmids, which show three large-scale duplications (adding up to 100 kb), were unequivocally confirmed by cosmid analysis. The chromosome of strain R1 is completely colinear and virtually identical to that of strain NRC-1. Correlation of the plasmid sequences revealed 210 kb of sequence that occurs only in strain R1. The remaining 350 kb shows virtual sequence identity in the two strains. Nevertheless, the number and overall structure of the plasmids are largely incompatible. Also, 20\% of the protein sequences differ despite the near identity at the DNA sequence level. Finally, we report genome-wide mobility data for insertion sequences from which we conclude that strains R1 and NRC-1 originate from the same natural isolate. This exemplifies evolution in the laboratory.}

We show here that this largely reflects codon usage because heavily used codons were found in the highly abundant oligomers whereas rarely used codons, with some exceptions, occurred in sequences in low abundance. Furthermore, linear regression analysis revealed a strong correlation between the frequencies of each trinucleotide and its usage as a codon. Dinucleotides are also not randomly distributed across each codon position and the dinucleotide composition of genes that are transcribed but not translated (rRNA and tRNA genes) was highly related to that seen in genes encoding polypeptides. However, 45 tetra-, 8 penta-, and 6 hexanucleotides were significantly over- or underabundant by Markov chain analysis and could not be accounted for by codon usage. Of these underrepresented sequences, many were palindromes, including the Dam methylation site.}

	abstract = {Selective pressures on proteins are usually measured by comparing nucleotide sequences. Here we introduce a method to detect selection on the basis of a single genome sequence. We catalogue the relative strength of selection on each gene in the entire genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Our analysis confirms that most antigens are under strong selection for amino-acid substitutions, particularly the PE/PPE family of putative surface proteins in M. tuberculosis and the EMP1 family of cytoadhering surface proteins in P. falciparum. We also identify many uncharacterized proteins that are under strong selection in each pathogen. We provide a genome-wide analysis of natural selection acting on different stages of an organism's life cycle: genes expressed in the ring stage of P. falciparum are under stronger positive selection than those expressed in other stages of the parasite's life cycle. Our method of estimating selective pressures requires far fewer data than comparative sequence analysis, and it measures selection across an entire genome; the method can readily be applied to a large range of sequenced organisms.}

Commonly, the sequences are grouped into operational taxonomic units based on genetic distance (sequence similarity) instead of genetic change (patristic distance). This method may fail to adequately identify clusters of evolutionary related sequences and it provides no information on the phylogenetic structure of the community. An ease-of-use web application for this purpose has been missing. RESULTS: We have developed RAMI, which clusters related nodes in a phylogenetic tree based on the patristic distance. RAMI also produces indices of cluster properties and other indices used in population and community studies on-the-fly.

	abstract = {Monitoring diversity changes and contamination in mixed cultures and simple microcosms is challenged by fast community structure dynamics, and the need for means allowing fast, cost-efficient and accurate identification of microorganisms at high phylogenetic resolution. The method we explored is a variant of Automated rRNA Intergenic Spacer Analysis based on Intra-Genomic Diversity Fingerprinting (ARISA-IGDF), and identifies phylotypes with multiple 16S-23S rRNA gene Intergenic Transcribed Spacers. We verified the effect of PCR conditions (annealing temperature, duration of final extension, number of cycles, group-specific primers and formamide) on ARISA-IGD fingerprints of 44 strains of Shewanella. We present a digitization algorithm and data analysis procedures needed to determine confidence in strain identification. Though using stringent PCR conditions and group-specific primers allow reasonably accurate identification of strains with three ARISA-IGD amplicons within the 82-1000 bp size range, ARISA-IGDF is best for phylotypes with >or=4 unambiguously different amplicons. This method allows monitoring the occurrence of culturable microbes and can be implemented in applications requiring high phylogenetic resolution, reproducibility, low cost and high throughput such as identifying contamination and monitoring the evolution of diversity in mixed cultures and low diversity microcosms and periodic screening of small microbial culture libraries.}

Strand-specific mutational bias causes compositional asymmetry of the nucleotides between leading and lagging strands (LaS) in bacterial chromosomes. Keeping in view the aforementioned points, CUB between the strands were compared in Escherichia coli chromosome. In comparison with HEG, codon usage of WEG was observed to be more biased toward strands: G ending codons were significantly more in leading strands than in LaS and the reverse was true for the C ending codons. In case of WEG, the GC(3) skews were found to be significantly different between the strands. This suggests that strand-specific mutational bias influences codon usage of WEG to a greater extent than that of HEG. The differential effect of strand-specific mutational bias in E. coli might be attributed to stronger purifying selection in the HEG than the WEG. The observation here in E. coli supports the SMD theory of molecular evolution.}

	abstract = {Gene families are growing rapidly, but standard methods for inferring phylogenies do not scale to alignments with over 10,000 sequences. We present FastTree, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, FastTree stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. FastTree uses these profiles to implement Neighbor-Joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. FastTree then uses nearest neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N(2)) space and O(N(2)L) time, but FastTree requires just O(NLa + N ) memory and O(N log (N)La) time. To estimate the tree's reliability, FastTree uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, FastTree computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs in 17 h and 2.4 GB of memory. Just computing pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 h and 50 GB of memory. In simulations, FastTree was slightly more accurate than Neighbor-Joining, BIONJ, or FastME; on genuine alignments, FastTree's topologies had higher likelihoods.

	abstract = {We compared nucleotide usage pattern conservation for related prokaryotes by examining the representation of DNA tetranucleotide combinations in 27 representative microbial genomes. For each of the organisms studied, tetranucleotide usage departures from expectations (TUD) were shared between related organisms using both Markov chain analysis and a zero-order Markov method. Individual strains, multiple chromosomes, plasmids, and bacteriophages share TUDs within a species. TUDs varied between coding and noncoding DNA. Grouping prokaryotes based on TUD profiles resulted in relationships with important differences from those based on 16S rRNA phylogenies, which may reflect unequal rates of evolution of nucleotide usage patterns following divergence of particular organisms from a common ancestor. By both symmetrical tree distance and likelihood analysis, phylogenetic trees based on TUD profiles demonstrate a level of congruence with 16S rRNA trees similar to that of both RpoA and RecA trees. Congruence of these trees indicates that there exists phylogenetic signal in TUD patterns, most prominent in coding region DNA. Because relationships demonstrated in TUD-based analyses utilize whole genomes, they should be considered complementary to phylogenies based on single genetic elements, such as 16S rRNA.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Virus taxonomy is based on morphologic characteristics, as there are no widely used non-phenotypic measures for comparison among virus families. We examined whether there is phylogenetic signal in virus nucleotide usage patterns that can be used to determine ancestral relationships. The well-studied model of tail morphology in bacteriophage classification was used for comparison with nucleotide usage patterns. Tetranucleotide usage deviation (TUD) patterns were chosen since they have previously been shown to contain phylogenetic signal similar to that of 16S rRNA. RESULTS: We found that bacteriophages have unique TUD patterns, representing genomic signatures that are relatively conserved among those with similar host range. Analysis of TUD-based phylogeny indicates that host influences are important in bacteriophage evolution, and phylogenies containing both phages and their hosts support their co-evolution. TUD-based phylogeny of eukaryotic viruses indicates that they cluster largely based on nucleic acid type and genome size. Similarities between eukaryotic virus phylogenies based on TUD and gene content substantiate the TUD methodology. CONCLUSION: Differences between phenotypic and TUD analysis may provide clues to virus ancestry not previously inferred. As such, TUD analysis provides a complementary approach to morphology-based systems in analysis of virus evolution.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Metagenomic analysis provides a rich source of biological information for otherwise intractable viral communities. However, study of viral metagenomes has been hampered by its nearly complete reliance on BLAST algorithms for identification of DNA sequences. We sought to develop algorithms for examination of viral metagenomes to identify the origin of sequences independent of BLAST algorithms. We chose viral metagenomes obtained from two hot springs, Bear Paw and Octopus, in Yellowstone National Park, as they represent simple microbial populations where comparatively large contigs were obtained. Thermal spring metagenomes have high proportions of sequences without significant Genbank homology, which has hampered identification of viruses and their linkage with hosts. To analyze each metagenome, we developed a method to classify DNA fragments using genome signature-based phylogenetic classification (GSPC), where metagenomic fragments are compared to a database of oligonucleotide signatures for all previously sequenced Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses. RESULTS: From both Bear Paw and Octopus hot springs, each assembled contig had more similarity to other metagenome contigs than to any sequenced microbial genome based on GSPC analysis, suggesting a genome signature common to each of these extreme environments. While viral metagenomes from Bear Paw and Octopus share some similarity, the genome signatures from each locale are largely unique. GSPC using a microbial database predicts most of the Octopus metagenome has archaeal signatures, while bacterial signatures predominate in Bear Paw; a finding consistent with those of Genbank BLAST. When using a viral database, the majority of the Octopus metagenome is predicted to belong to archaeal virus Families Globuloviridae and Fuselloviridae, while none of the Bear Paw metagenome is predicted to belong to archaeal viruses. As expected, when microbial and viral databases are combined, each of the Octopus and Bear Paw metagenomic contigs are predicted to belong to viruses rather than to any Bacteria or Archaea, consistent with the apparent viral origin of both metagenomes. CONCLUSIONS: That BLAST searches identify no significant homologs for most metagenome contigs, while GSPC suggests their origin as archaeal viruses or bacteriophages, indicates GSPC provides a complementary approach in viral metagenomic analysis.}

The ARB software suite with its corresponding rRNA datasets has been accepted by researchers worldwide as a standard tool for large scale rRNA analysis. However, the rapid increase of publicly available rRNA sequence data has recently hampered the maintenance of comprehensive and curated rRNA knowledge databases. A new system, SILVA (from Latin silva, forest), was implemented to provide a central comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality controlled databases of aligned rRNA sequences from the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya domains. All sequences are checked for anomalies, carry a rich set of sequence associated contextual information, have multiple taxonomic classifications, and the latest validly described nomenclature. Furthermore, two precompiled sequence datasets compatible with ARB are offered for download on the SILVA website: (i) the reference (Ref) datasets, comprising only high quality, nearly full length sequences suitable for in-depth phylogenetic analysis and probe design and (ii) the comprehensive Parc datasets with all publicly available rRNA sequences longer than 300 nucleotides suitable for biodiversity analyses. The latest publicly available database release 91 (August 2007) hosts 547 521 sequences split into 461 823 small subunit and 85 689 large subunit rRNAs.}

The new method circumvents the ambiguity of choosing the genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and avoids the necessity of aligning sequences of essentially different length and gene content. The only "parameter" in the method is the length K of the oligopeptides, which serves to tune the "resolution power" of the method. The topology of the trees converges with K increasing. Applied to a total of 109 organisms, including 16 Archaea, 87 Bacteria, and 6 Eukarya, it yields an unrooted tree that agrees with the biologists' "tree of life" based on SSU rRNA comparison in a majority of basic branchings, and especially, in all lower taxa.}

	abstract = {Composition Vector Tree (CVTree) implements a systematic method of inferring evolutionary relatedness of microbial organisms from the oligopeptide content of their complete proteomes (http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn). Since the first bacterial genomes were sequenced in 1995 there have been several attempts to infer prokaryote phylogeny from complete genomes. Most of them depend on sequence alignment directly or indirectly and, in some cases, need fine-tuning and adjustment. The composition vector method circumvents the ambiguity of choosing the genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and avoids the necessity of aligning sequences of essentially different length and gene content. This new method does not contain 'free' parameter and 'fine-tuning'. A bootstrap test for a phylogenetic tree of 139 organisms has shown the stability of the branchings, which support the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) tree of life in its overall structure and in many details. It may provide a quick reference in prokaryote phylogenetics whenever the proteome of an organism is available, a situation that will become commonplace in the near future.}

A thorough investigation is needed in order to study the relationship between nucleotide composition dynamics and gene distribution biases. Based on a collection of 364 eubacterial genomes that were grouped according to a DnaE-based scheme (DnaE1-DnaE1, DnaE2-DnaE1, and DnaE3-PolC), we investigated NCA and nucleotide composition gradients at three codon positions and found that there was universal G-enrichment on LeS among all groups. This was due to a strong selection for G-heading (codon position1 or cp1) codons and mutation pressure that led to more G-ending (cp3) codons. Moreover, a slight T-enrichment of LeS due to the mutation of cytosine deamination at cp3 was universal among DnaE1-DnaE1 and DnaE2-DnaE1 genomes, but was not clearly seen among DnaE3-PolC genomes, in which A-enrichment of LeS was proposed to be the effect of selections unique to polC and a mutation bias toward A-richness at cp1 that may be a result of transcription-coupled DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, strand-biased gene distribution enhances the purine-richness of LeS for DnaE3-PolC genomes and T-richness of LeS for DnaE1-DnaE1 and DnaE2-dnaE1 genomes.}

	abstract = {Understanding the identity and changes of organisms in the urogenital and other microbiomes of the human body may be key to discovering causes and new treatments of many ailments, such as vaginosis. High-throughput sequencing technologies have recently enabled discovery of the great diversity of the human microbiome. The cost per base of many of these sequencing platforms remains high (thousands of dollars per sample); however, the Illumina Genome Analyzer (IGA) is estimated to have a cost per base less than one-fifth of its nearest competitor. The main disadvantage of the IGA for sequencing PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes is that the maximum read-length of the IGA is only 100 bases; whereas, at least 300 bases are needed to obtain phylogenetically informative data down to the genus and species level. In this paper we describe and conduct a pilot test of a multiplex sequencing strategy suitable for achieving total reads of > 300 bases per extracted DNA molecule on the IGA. Results show that all proposed primers produce products of the expected size and that correct sequences can be obtained, with all proposed forward primers. Various bioinformatic optimization of the Illumina Bustard analysis pipeline proved necessary to extract the correct sequence from IGA image data, and these modifications of the data files indicate that further optimization of the analysis pipeline may improve the quality rankings of the data and enable more sequence to be correctly analyzed. The successful application of this method could result in an unprecedentedly deep description (800,000 taxonomic identifications per sample) of the urogenital and other microbiomes in a large number of samples at a reasonable cost per sample.}

We detected 2033 proteins from the five most abundant species in the biofilm, including 48\% of the predicted proteins from the dominant biofilm organism, Leptospirillum group II. Proteins involved in protein refolding and response to oxidative stress appeared to be highly expressed, which suggests that damage to biomolecules is a key challenge for survival. We validated and estimated the relative abundance and cellular localization of 357 unique and 215 conserved novel proteins and determined that one abundant novel protein is a cytochrome central to iron oxidation and AMD formation.}

Currently, only 26 of the approximately 52 identifiable major lineages, or phyla, within the domain Bacteria have cultivated representatives. Evidence from field studies indicates that many of the uncultivated phyla are found in diverse habitats, and some are extraordinarily abundant. In some important environments, including seawater, freshwater, and soil, many biologically and geochemically important organisms are at best only remotely related to any strain that has been characterized by phenotype or by genome sequencing. Genome sequence information that would allow ribosomal RNA gene trees to be related to broader patterns in microbial genome evolution is scant, and therefore microbial diversity remains largely unexplored territory.}

	abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing has been skewed toward bacterial pathogens as a consequence of the prioritization of medical and veterinary diseases. However, it is becoming clear that in order to accurately measure genetic variation within and between pathogenic groups, multiple isolates, as well as commensal species, must be sequenced. This study examined the pangenomic content of Escherichia coli. Six distinct E. coli pathovars can be distinguished using molecular or phenotypic markers, but only two of the six pathovars have been subjected to any genome sequencing previously. Thus, this report provides a seminal description of the genomic contents and unique features of three unsequenced pathovars, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli. We also determined the first genome sequence of a human commensal E. coli isolate, E. coli HS, which will undoubtedly provide a new baseline from which workers can examine the evolution of pathogenic E. coli. Comparison of 17 E. coli genomes, 8 of which are new, resulted in identification of approximately 2,200 genes conserved in all isolates. We were also able to identify genes that were isolate and pathovar specific. Fewer pathovar-specific genes were identified than anticipated, suggesting that each isolate may have independently developed virulence capabilities. Pangenome calculations indicate that E. coli genomic diversity represents an open pangenome model containing a reservoir of more than 13,000 genes, many of which may be uncharacterized but important virulence factors. This comparative study of the species E. coli, while descriptive, should provide the basis for future functional work on this important group of pathogens.}

	abstract = {Global efforts to conserve species have been strongly influenced by the heterogeneous distribution of species diversity across the Earth. This is manifest in conservation efforts focused on diversity hotspots. The conservation of genetic diversity within an individual species is an important factor in its survival in the face of environmental changes and disease. Here we show that diversity within species is also distributed unevenly. Using simple genealogical models, we show that genetic distinctiveness has a scale-free power law distribution. This property implies that a disproportionate fraction of the diversity is concentrated in small sub-populations, even when the population is well-mixed. Small groups are of such importance to overall population diversity that even without extrinsic perturbations, there are large fluctuations in diversity owing to extinctions of these small groups. We also show that diversity can be geographically non-uniform--potentially including sharp boundaries between distantly related organisms--without extrinsic causes such as barriers to gene flow or past migration events. We obtained these results by studying the fundamental scaling properties of genealogical trees. Our theoretical results agree with field data from global samples of Pseudomonas bacteria. Contrary to previous studies, our results imply that diversity loss owing to severe extinction events is high, and focusing conservation efforts on highly distinctive groups can save much of the diversity.}

Counts of occurrence, counts of clumps, and renewal counts are distinguished, and exact distributions as well as normal approximations, Poisson process approximations, and compound Poisson approximations are derived. Here, a sequence is modelled as a stationary ergodic Markov chain; a test for determining the appropriate order of the Markov chain is described. The convergence results take the error made by estimating the Markovian transition probabilities into account. The main tools involved are moment generating functions, martingales, Stein's method, and the Chen-Stein method. Similar results are given for occurrences of multiple patterns, and, as an example, the problem of unique recoverability of a sequence from SBH chip data is discussed. Special emphasis lies on disentangling the complicated dependence structure between word occurrences, due to self-overlap as well as due to overlap between words. The results can be used to derive approximate, and conservative, confidence intervals for tests.}

OUV reflects the strength of OU biases and taxonomic signals. PS denotes asymmetry of OU in direct and reverse DNA strands. A trend towards minimal PS was observed for almost all complete sequences of bacterial chromosomes and plasmids, however, PS was substantially higher in separate genomic loci and several types of plasmids and phages characterized by long stretches of non-coding DNA and/or asymmetric gene distribution on the two DNA strands. Five of the 155 bacterial chromosomes have anomalously high PS, of which the chromosomes of Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c and Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313 exhibit extreme PS values suggesting an intermediate unstable state of these two genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Strand symmetry as indicated by minimal PS is a universally conserved feature of complete bacterial genomes that results from the matching mutual compensation of local OU biases on both replichors while OUV is more a taxon specific feature. Local events such as inversions or the incorporation of genome islands are balanced by global changes in genome organization to minimize PS that may represent one of the leading evolutionary forces driving bacterial genome diversification.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complete sequencing of bacterial genomes has become a common technique of present day microbiology. Thereafter, data mining in the complete sequence is an essential step. New in silico methods are needed that rapidly identify the major features of genome organization and facilitate the prediction of the functional class of ORFs. We tested the usefulness of local oligonucleotide usage (OU) patterns to recognize and differentiate types of atypical oligonucleotide composition in DNA sequences of bacterial genomes. RESULTS: A total of 163 bacterial genomes of eubacteria and archaea published in the NCBI database were analyzed. Local OU patterns exhibit substantial intrachromosomal variation in bacteria. Loci with alternative OU patterns were parts of horizontally acquired gene islands or ancient regions such as genes for ribosomal proteins and RNAs. OU statistical parameters, such as local pattern deviation (D), pattern skew (PS) and OU variance (OUV) enabled the detection and visualization of gene islands of different functional classes. CONCLUSION: A set of approaches has been designed for the statistical analysis of nucleotide sequences of bacterial genomes. These methods are useful for the visualization and differentiation of regions with atypical oligonucleotide composition prior to or accompanying gene annotation.}

	abstract = {DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) has been used for nearly 50 years as the gold standard for prokaryotic species circumscriptions at the genomic level. It has been the only taxonomic method that offered a numerical and relatively stable species boundary, and its use has had a paramount influence on how the current classification has been constructed. However, now, in the era of genomics, DDH appears to be an outdated method for classification that needs to be substituted. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) between two genomes seems the most promising method since it mirrors DDH closely. Here we examine the work package JSpecies as a user-friendly, biologist-oriented interface to calculate ANI and the correlation of the tetranucleotide signatures between pairwise genomic comparisons. The results agreed with the use of ANI to substitute DDH, with a narrowed boundary that could be set at approximately 95-96\%. In addition, the JSpecies package implemented the tetranucleotide signature correlation index, an alignment-free parameter that generally correlates with ANI and that can be of help in deciding when a given pair of organisms should be classified in the same species. Moreover, for taxonomic purposes, the analyses can be produced by simply randomly sequencing at least 20\% of the genome of the query strains rather than obtaining their full sequence.}

Microorganisms represent two of the three domains of life and contain vast diversity that is the product of an estimated 3.8 billion years of evolution. In many environments, as many as 99\% of the microorganisms cannot be cultured by standard techniques, and the uncultured fraction includes diverse organisms that are only distantly related to the cultured ones. Therefore, culture-independent methods are essential to understand the genetic diversity, population structure, and ecological roles of the majority of microorganisms. Metagenomics, or the culture-independent genomic analysis of an assemblage of microorganisms, has potential to answer fundamental questions in microbial ecology. This review describes progress toward understanding the biology of uncultured Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses through metagenomic analyses.}

	abstract = {We have explored compositional variation at synonymous (codon usage) and nonsynonymous (amino acid usage) positions in three complete genomes of Buchnera, endosymbiotic bacteria of aphids, and also in their orthologs in Escherichia coli, a close free-living relative. We sought to discriminate genes of variable expression levels in order to weigh the relative contributions of mutational bias and selection in the genomic changes following symbiosis. We identified clear strand asymmetries, distribution biases (putative high-expression genes were found more often on the leading strand), and a residual slight codon bias within each strand. Amino acid usage was strongly biased in putative high-expression genes, characterized by avoidance of aromatic amino acids, but above all by greater conservation and resistance to AT enrichment. Despite the almost complete loss of codon bias and heavy mutational pressure, selective forces are still strong at nonsynonymous sites of a fraction of the genome. However, Buchnera from Baizongia pistaciae appears to have suffered a stronger symbiotic syndrome than the two other species.}

	abstract = {Ribosomal signatures, idiosyncrasies in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and/or proteins, are characteristic of the individual domains of life. As such, insight into the early evolution of the domains can be gained from a comparative analysis of their respective signatures in the translational apparatus. In this work, we identify signatures in both the sequence and structure of the rRNA and analyze their contributions to the universal phylogenetic tree using both sequence- and structure-based methods. Domain-specific ribosomal proteins can be considered signatures in their own right. Although it is commonly assumed that they developed after the universal ribosomal proteins, we present evidence that at least one may have been present before the divergence of the organismal lineages. We find correlations between the rRNA signatures and signatures in the ribosomal proteins showing that the rRNA signatures coevolved with both domain-specific and universal ribosomal proteins. Finally, we show that the genomic organization of the universal ribosomal components contains these signatures as well. From these studies, we propose the ribosomal signatures are remnants of an evolutionary-phase transition that occurred as the cell lineages began to coalesce and so should be reflected in corresponding signatures throughout the fabric of the cell and its genome.}

	abstract = {We present a general analysis of oligonucleotide usage in the complete genome of Bacillus subtilis . Several datasets were built in order to assign various biological contexts to the biased use of words and to reveal local asymmetries in word usage that may be coupled with replication, the control of gene expression and the restriction/modification system. This analysis was complemented by cross-comparisons with the complete genomes of Escherichia coli , Haemophilus influenzae and Methanococcus jannaschii . We have observed a large number of biased oligonucleotides for words of size up to 8, throughout the datasets and species, indicating that such long strict words play an important role as biological signals. We speculate that some of them are involved in interactions with DNA and/or RNA polymerases. An extensive analysis of palindrome abundances and distributions provides the surprising result that prophage-like elements embedded in the genome exhibit a smaller avoidance of restriction sites. This may reinforce a recently proposed hypothesis of a selfish gene phenomena in the transfer of restriction/modification systems in bacteria.}

Strong compositional asymmetries between the genes lying on the leading versus lagging strands were observed at the level of nucleotides, codons and, surprisingly, amino acids. For some species, the bias is so high that the sole knowledge of a protein sequence allows one to predict with almost no errors whether the gene is transcribed from one strand or the other. Furthermore, we show that these biases are not species specific but appear to be universal. These findings may have important consequences in our understanding of fundamental biological processes in bacteria, such as replication fidelity, codon usage in genes and even amino acid usage in proteins.}

First, we analyzed the composition asymmetry of 28 complete bacterial genomes and used it to test the possibility that asymmetric deamination of cytosine might be at the origin of the bias. The model showed significant correlation to the data but left unexplained a significant portion of the variance and indicated a systematic underestimation of GC skews in comparison with TA skews. Second, we analyzed the substitutions acting on the genes from five fully sequenced Chlamydia genomes that had not suffered strand switch since speciation. This analysis showed that substitutions were not at equilibrium in Chlamydia trachomatis or in C. muridarum and that strand bias is still an on-going process in these genes. Third, we identified substitutions involved in the adaptation of genes that had switched strands after speciation. These genes adapted quickly to the skewed composition of the new strand, mostly due to C-->T, A-->G, and C-->G asymmetric substitutions. This observation was reinforced by the analysis of genes that switched strands after divergence between Bacillus subtilis and B. halodurans. Finally, we propose a more extended model based on the analysis of the substitution asymmetries of CHLAMYDIA: This model fits well with the data provided by bacterial genomes presenting strong strand bias.}

	abstract = {The GC content of bacterial genomes varies from 25 to 75\%, but the reason for this variation is unclear. Here, we show that genomes of bacteria that rely on their host for survival (obligatory pathogens or symbionts) tend to be AT rich. Furthermore, we have analysed bacterial phages, plasmids and insertion sequences, which might also be regarded as 'intracellular pathogens', and show that they too are significantly richer in AT than their hosts. We suggest that the higher energy cost and limited availability of G and C over A and T/U could be a basis for the understanding of these differences.}

	abstract = {The selection-mutation-drift theory of codon usage plays a major role in the theory of molecular evolution by explaining the co-evolution of codon usage bias and tRNA content in the framework of translation optimization. Because most studies have focused only on codon usage, we analyzed the tRNA gene pool of 102 bacterial species. We show that as minimal generation times get shorter, the genomes contain more tRNA genes, but fewer anticodon species. Surprisingly, despite the wide G+C variation of bacterial genomes these anticodons are the same in most genomes. This suggests an optimization of the translation machinery to use a small subset of optimal codons and anticodons in fast-growing bacteria and in highly expressed genes. As a result, the overrepresented codons in highly expressed genes tend to be the same in very different genomes to match the same most-frequent anticodons. This is particularly important in fast-growing bacteria, which have higher codon usage bias in these genes. Three models were tested to understand the choice of codons recognized by the same anticodons, all providing significant fit, but under different classes of genes and genomes. Thus, co-evolution of tRNA gene composition and codon usage bias in genomes seen from tRNA's point of view agrees with the selection-mutation-drift theory. However, it suggests a much more universal trend in the evolution of anticodon and codon choice than previously thought. It also provides new evidence that a selective force for the optimization of the translation machinery is the maximization of growth.}

	abstract = {The replication of the chromosome is among the most essential functions of the bacterial cell and influences many other cellular mechanisms, from gene expression to cell division. Yet the way it impacts on the bacterial chromosome was not fully acknowledged until the availability of complete genomes allowed one to look upon genomes as more than bags of genes. Chromosomal replication includes a set of asymmetric mechanisms, among which are a division in a lagging and a leading strand and a gradient between early and late replicating regions. These differences are the causes of many of the organizational features observed in bacterial genomes, in terms of both gene distribution and sequence composition along the chromosome. When asymmetries or gradients increase in some genomes, e.g. due to a different composition of the DNA polymerase or to a higher growth rate, so do the corresponding biases. As some of the features of the chromosome structure seem to be under strong selection, understanding such biases is important for the understanding of chromosome organization and adaptation. Inversely, understanding chromosome organization may shed further light on questions relating to replication and cell division. Ultimately, the understanding of the interplay between these different elements will allow a better understanding of bacterial genetics and evolution.}

	abstract = {The variation of amino acid substitution rates in proteins depends on several variables. Among these, the protein's expression level, functional category, essentiality, or metabolic costs of its amino acid residues may play an important role. However, the relative importance of each variable has not yet been evaluated in comparative analyses. To this aim, we made regression analyses combining data available on these variables and on evolutionary rates, in two well-documented model bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In both bacteria, the level of expression of the protein in the cell was by far the most important driving force constraining the amino acids substitution rate. Subsequent inclusion in the analysis of the other variables added little further information. Furthermore, when the rates of synonymous substitutions were included in the analysis of the E. coli data, only the variable expression levels remained statistically significant. The rate of nonsynonymous substitution was shown to correlate with expression levels independently of the rate of synonymous substitution. These results suggest an important direct influence of expression levels, or at least codon usage bias for translation optimization, on the rates of nonsynonymous substitutions in bacteria. They also indicate that when a control for this variable is included, essentiality plays no significant role in the rate of protein evolution in bacteria, as is the case in eukaryotes.}

	abstract = {Compositional replication strand bias, commonly referred to as GC skew, is present in many genomes of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses. Although cytosine deamination in ssDNA (resulting in C-->T changes on the leading strand) is often invoked as its major cause, the precise contributions of this and other substitution types are currently unknown. It is also unclear if the underlying mutational asymmetries are the same among taxa, are stable over time, or how closely the observed biases are to mutational equilibrium. We analyzed nearly neutral sites of seven taxa each with between three and six complete bacterial genomes, and inferred the substitution spectra of fourfold degenerate positions in nonhighly expressed genes. Using a bootstrap procedure, we extracted compositional biases associated with replication and identified the significant asymmetries. Although all taxa showed an overrepresentation of G relative to C on the leading strand (and imbalances between A and T), widely variable substitution asymmetries are noted. Surprisingly, all substitution types show significant asymmetry in at least one taxon, but none were universally biased in all taxa. Notably, in the two most biased genomes, A-->G, rather than C-->T, shapes the compositional bias. Given the variability in these biases, we propose that the process is multifactorial. Finally, we also find that most genomes are not at compositional equilibrium, and suggest that mutational-based heterotachy is deeply imprinted in the history of biological macromolecules. This shows that similar compositional biases associated with the same essential well-conserved process, replication, do not reflect similar mutational processes in different genomes, and that caution is required in inferring the roles of specific mutational biases on the basis of contemporary patterns of sequence composition.}

Fortunately, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and computational analyses have ushered in the new field of metagenomics, which aims to decode the genomes of microbes from natural communities without the need for cultivation. Although metagenomic studies have shed a great deal of insight into bacterial diversity and coding capacity, several computational challenges remain due to the massive size and complexity of metagenomic sequence data. Current tools and techniques are reviewed in this paper which address challenges in 1) genomic fragment annotation, 2) phylogenetic reconstruction, 3) functional classification of samples, and 4) interpreting complementary metaproteomics and metametabolomics data. Also surveyed are important applications of metagenomic studies, including microbial forensics and the roles of microbial communities in shaping human health and soil ecology.}

Prokaryotic species concept has its own history and results from a series of empirical improvements parallel to the development of the techniques of analysis. Among the microbial taxonomists, there is general agreement that the species concept currently in use is useful, pragmatic and universally applicable within the prokaryotic world. However, this empirically designed concept is not encompassed by any of the, at least, 22 concepts described for eukaryotes. The species could be described as 'a monophyletic and genomically coherent cluster of individual organisms that show a high degree of overall similarity in many independent characteristics, and is diagnosable by a discriminative phenotypic property'. We suggest to refer it as a phylo-phenetic species concept. Here, we discuss the validity of the concept in use which we believe is more pragmatic in comparison with those concepts described for eukaryotes.}

We address the following questions: how much does the discriminatory power of a classifier depend on the choice of the algorithm that was used to identify it; what alternative classifiers could be used just as well; how robust is the result. The answers to these questions are essential prerequisites for validation and biological interpretation of the classifiers.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Same-strand overlapping genes may occur in frameshifts of one (phase 1) or two nucleotides (phase 2). In previous studies of bacterial genomes, long phase-1 overlaps were found to be more numerous than long phase-2 overlaps. This bias was explained by either genomic location or an unspecified selection advantage. Model that focused on the ability of the two genes to evolve independently did not predict this phase bias. Here, we propose that a purely compositional model explains the phase bias in a more parsimonious manner. Same-strand overlapping genes may arise through either a mutation at the termination codon of the upstream gene or a mutation at the initiation codon of the downstream gene. We hypothesized that given these two scenarios, the frequencies of initiation and termination codons in the two phases may determine the number for overlapping genes. RESULTS: We examined the frequencies of initiation- and termination-codons in the two phases, and found that termination codons do not significantly differ between the two phases, whereas initiation codons are more abundant in phase 1. We found that the primary factors explaining the phase inequality are the frequencies of amino acids whose codons may combine to form start codons in the two phases. We show that the frequencies of start codons in each of the two phases, and, hence, the potential for the creation of overlapping genes, are determined by a universal amino-acid frequency and species-specific codon usage, leading to a correlation between long phase-1 overlaps and genomic GC content. CONCLUSIONS: Our model explains the phase bias in same-strand overlapping genes by compositional factors without invoking selection. Therefore, it can be used as a null model of neutral evolution to test selection hypotheses concerning the evolution of overlapping genes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The characterisation, or binning, of metagenome fragments is an important first step to further downstream analysis of microbial consortia. Here, we propose a one-dimensional signature, OFDEG, derived from the oligonucleotide frequency profile of a DNA sequence, and show that it is possible to obtain a meaningful phylogenetic signal for relatively short DNA sequences. The one-dimensional signal is essentially a compact representation of higher dimensional feature spaces of greater complexity and is intended to improve on the tetranucleotide frequency feature space preferred by current compositional binning methods. RESULTS: We compare the fidelity of OFDEG against tetranucleotide frequency in both an unsupervised and semi-supervised setting on simulated metagenome benchmark data. Four tests were conducted using assembler output of Arachne and phrap, and for each, performance was evaluated on contigs which are greater than or equal to 8 kbp in length and contigs which are composed of at least 10 reads. Using both G-C content in conjunction with OFDEG gave an average accuracy of 96.75\% (semi-supervised) and 95.19\% (unsupervised), versus 94.25\% (semi-supervised) and 82.35\% (unsupervised) for tetranucleotide frequency. CONCLUSION: We have presented an observation of an alternative characteristic of DNA sequences. The proposed feature representation has proven to be more beneficial than the existing tetranucleotide frequency space to the metagenome binning problem. We do note, however, that our observation of OFDEG deserves further anlaysis and investigation. Unsupervised clustering revealed OFDEG related features performed better than standard tetranucleotide frequency in representing a relevant organism specific signal. Further improvement in binning accuracy is given by semi-supervised classification using OFDEG. The emphasis on a feature-driven, bottom-up approach to the problem of binning reveals promising avenues for future development of techniques to characterise short environmental sequences without bias toward cultivable organisms.}

	abstract = {To study the possible codon usage and base composition variation in the bacteriophages, fourteen mycobacteriophages were used as a model system here and both the parameters in all these phages and their plating bacteria, M. smegmatis had been determined and compared. As all the organisms are GC-rich, the GC contents at third codon positions were found in fact higher than the second codon positions as well as the first + second codon positions in all the organisms indicating that directional mutational pressure is strongly operative at the synonymous third codon positions. Nc plot indicates that codon usage variation in all these organisms are governed by the forces other than compositional constraints. Correspondence analysis suggests that: (i) there are codon usage variation among the genes and genomes of the fourteen mycobacteriophages and M. smegmatis, i.e., codon usage patterns in the mycobacteriophages is phage-specific but not the M. smegmatis-specific; (ii) synonymous codon usage patterns of Barnyard, Che8, Che9d, and Omega are more similar than the rest mycobacteriophages and M. smegmatis; (iii) codon usage bias in the mycobacteriophages are mainly determined by mutational pressure; and (iv) the genes of comparatively GC rich genomes are more biased than the GC poor genomes. Translational selection in determining the codon usage variation in highly expressed genes can be invoked from the predominant occurrences of C ending codons in the highly expressed genes. Cluster analysis based on codon usage data also shows that there are two distinct branches for the fourteen mycobacteriophages and there is codon usage variation even among the phages of each branch.}

	abstract = {The putative origin of replication in prokaryotic genomes can be located by a new method that finds short oligomers whose orientation is preferentially skewed around the origin. The skewed oligomer method is shown to work for all bacterial genomes and one of three archaeal genomes sequences to date, confirming known or predicted origins in most cases and in three cases (H. pylori, M. thermoautotrophicum, and Synechocystis sp.), suggesting origins that were previously unknown. In many cases, the presence of conserved genes and nucleotide motifs confirms the predictions. An algorithm for finding these skewed seven-base and eight-base sequences is described, along with a method for combining evidence from multiple skewed oligomers to accurately locate the replication origin. Possible explanations for the phenomenon of skewed oligomers are discussed. Explanations are presented for why some bacterial genomes contain hundreds of highly skewed oligomers, whereas others contain only a handful.}

	abstract = {This paper describes a new system, GLIMMER, for finding genes in microbial genomes. In a series of tests on Haemophilus influenzae , Helicobacter pylori and other complete microbial genomes, this system has proven to be very accurate at locating virtually all the genes in these sequences, outperforming previous methods. A conservative estimate based on experiments on H.pylori and H. influenzae is that the system finds >97\% of all genes. GLIMMER uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) as a framework for capturing dependencies between nearby nucleotides in a DNA sequence. An IMM-based method makes predictions based on a variable context; i.e., a variable-length oligomer in a DNA sequence. The context used by GLIMMER changes depending on the local composition of the sequence. As a result, GLIMMER is more flexible and more powerful than fixed-order Markov methods, which have previously been the primary content-based technique for finding genes in microbial DNA.}

	abstract = {2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) is a hazardous pollutant that is efficiently degraded by some aerobic soil bacterial isolates under laboratory conditions. The degradation of this pollutant in soils and its effect on the soil microbial community are poorly understood. We report here the ability of a previously unexposed forest soil microbiota to degrade high levels of 2,4,6-TCP and describe the changes in the soil microbial community found by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. After 30 days of incubation, about 50\% degradation of this pollutant was observed in soils amended with 50 to 5,000 ppm of 2,4,6-TCP. The T-RFLP analysis showed that the soil bacterial community was essentially unchanged after exposure to up to 500 ppm of 2,4,6-TCP. However, a significant decrease in richness was found with 2,000 and 5,000 ppm of 2,4,6-TCP, even though the removal of this pollutant remained high. The introduction of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 or R. eutropha MS1, two efficient 2,4,6-TCP degraders, to this soil did not improve degradation of this pollutant, supporting the significant bioremediation potential of this previously unexposed, endogenous forest soil microbial community.}

	abstract = {Bacterial genomes have diverged during evolution, resulting in clearcut differences in their nucleotide composition, such as their GC content. The analysis of complete sequences of bacterial genomes also reveals the presence of nonrandom sequence variation, manifest in the frequency profile of specific short oligonucleotides. These frequency profiles constitute highly specific genomic signatures. Based on these differences in oligonucleotide frequency between bacterial genomes, we investigated the possibility of predicting the genome of origin for a specific genomic sequence. To this end, we developed a naïve Bayesian classifier and systematically analyzed 28 eubacterial and archaeal genomes. We found that sequences as short as 400 bases could be correctly classified with an accuracy of 85\%. We then applied the classifier to the identification of horizontal gene transfer events in whole-genome sequences and demonstrated the validity of our approach by correctly predicting the transfer of both the superoxide dismutase (sodC) and the bioC gene from Haemophilus influenzae to Neisseria meningitis, correctly identifying both the donor and recipient species. We believe that this classification methodology could be a valuable tool in biodiversity studies.}

	abstract = {Each prokaryote has a unique genomic signature as evidenced by a set of species-specific frequencies of short oligonucleotides. With respect to genomic signatures a bacterial genome is homogenous and the variation within a genome is smaller than the variations between genomes of different species. This study quantifies the species-specificity of genomic signatures in the complete genomes of 57 prokaryotes. The species-specificity in the genomic signature was related to the quantification of other sequence biases, such as G+C content, synonymous codon choice and amino acid usage. The results confirm that the genomic signature is genome-wide with high species-specificity in both coding and non-coding regions. In coding regions the species-specific bias in synonymous codon choice was comparable to the genomic signature, while the bias in amino acid usage only captured about 50\% of the species-specific bias in the genomic signature. A correlation between the species-specificity in synonymous codon choice and amino acid usage was identified, in which proteins with species-specific amino acid usage were also coded with species-specific synonymous codon choice. However, we demonstrated that the G+C content captures only approximately 40\% of the species-specificity in the genomic signature, and is insufficient to explain the species specificity in the non-coding regions. Thus, the species-specific bias in non-coding regions remains largely unknown. Further, we compared the genomic signature in relation to phylogenetic distance. This was performed in order to illustrate the feasibility of a hierarchical classification scheme in future applications of the described classification methodology in screening for horizontal gene transfer and biodiversity studies.}

	abstract = {Identifying exceptional motifs is often used for extracting information from long DNA sequences. The two difficulties of the method are the choice of the model that defines the expected frequencies of words and the approximation of the variance of the difference T(W) between the number of occurrences of a word W and its estimation. We consider here different Markov chain models, either with stationary or periodic transition probabilities. We estimate the variance of the difference T(W) by the conditional variance of the number of occurrences of W given the oligonucleotides counts that define the model. Two applications show how to use asymptotically standard normal statistics associated with the counts to describe a given sequence in terms of its outlying words. Sequences of Escherichia coli and of Bacillus subtilis are compared with respect to their exceptional tri- and tetranucleotides. For both bacteria, exceptional 3-words are mainly found in the coding frame. E. coli palindrome counts are analyzed in different models, showing that many overabundant words are one-letter mutations of avoided palindromes.}

New antibiotics and enzymes are among the early discoveries from metagenomics. Future refinement of methods that enrich for genes of particular function will accelerate the rate of discovery of useful molecules.}

	abstract = {Although copious qualitative information describes the members of the diverse microbial communities on Earth, statistical approaches for quantifying and comparing the numbers and compositions of lineages in communities are lacking. We present a method that addresses the challenge of assigning sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the genetic distances between sequences. We developed a computer program, DOTUR, which assigns sequences to OTUs by using either the furthest, average, or nearest neighbor algorithm for each distance level. DOTUR uses the frequency at which each OTU is observed to construct rarefaction and collector's curves for various measures of richness and diversity. We analyzed 16S rRNA gene libraries derived from Scottish and Amazonian soils and the Sargasso Sea with DOTUR, which assigned sequences to OTUs rapidly and reliably based on the genetic distances between sequences and identified previous inconsistencies and errors in assigning sequences to OTUs. An analysis of the two 16S rRNA gene libraries from soil demonstrated that they do not contain enough sequences to support a claim that they contain different numbers of bacterial lineages with statistical confidence (P > 0.05), nor do they contain enough sequences to provide a robust estimate of species richness when an OTU is defined as containing sequences that are no more than 3\% different from each other. In contrast, the richness of OTUs at the 3\% level in the Sargasso Sea collection began to plateau after the sampling of 690 sequences. We anticipate that an equivalent extent of sampling for soil would require sampling more than 10,000 sequences, almost 100 times the size of typical sequence collections obtained from soil.}

	abstract = {The recent advent of tools enabling statistical inferences to be drawn from comparisons of microbial communities has enabled the focus of microbial ecology to move from characterizing biodiversity to describing the distribution of that biodiversity. Although statistical tools have been developed to compare community structures across a phylogenetic tree, we lack tools to compare the memberships and structures of two communities at a particular operational taxonomic unit (OTU) definition. Furthermore, current tests of community structure do not indicate the similarity of the communities but only report the probability of a statistical hypothesis. Here we present a computer program, SONS, which implements nonparametric estimators for the fraction and richness of OTUs shared between two communities.}

	abstract = {For more than a century, microbiologists have sought to determine the species richness of bacteria in soil, but the extreme complexity and unknown structure of soil microbial communities have obscured the answer. We developed a statistical model that makes the problem of estimating richness statistically accessible by evaluating the characteristics of samples drawn from simulated communities with parametric community distributions. We identified simulated communities with rank-abundance distributions that followed a truncated lognormal distribution whose samples resembled the structure of 16S rRNA gene sequence collections made using Alaskan and Minnesotan soils. The simulated communities constructed based on the distribution of 16S rRNA gene sequences sampled from the Alaskan and Minnesotan soils had a richness of 5,000 and 2,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively, where an OTU represents a collection of sequences not more than 3\% distant from each other. To sample each of these OTUs in the Alaskan 16S rRNA gene library at least twice, 480,000 sequences would be required; however, to estimate the richness of the simulated communities using nonparametric richness estimators would require only 18,000 sequences. Quantifying the richness of complex environments such as soil is an important step in building an ecological framework. We have shown that generating sufficient sequence data to do so requires less sequencing effort than completely sequencing a bacterial genome.}

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified fragments that target variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene has quickly become a powerful method for analyzing the membership and structure of microbial communities. This approach has revealed and introduced questions that were not fully appreciated by those carrying out traditional Sanger sequencing-based methods. These include the effects of alignment quality, the best method of calculating pairwise genetic distances for 16S rRNA genes, whether it is appropriate to filter variable regions, and how the choice of variable region relates to the genetic diversity observed in full-length sequences. I used a diverse collection of 13,501 high-quality full-length sequences to assess each of these questions. First, alignment quality had a significant impact on distance values and downstream analyses. Specifically, the greengenes alignment, which does a poor job of aligning variable regions, predicted higher genetic diversity, richness, and phylogenetic diversity than the SILVA and RDP-based alignments. Second, the effect of different gap treatments in determining pairwise genetic distances was strongly affected by the variation in sequence length for a region; however, the effect of different calculation methods was subtle when determining the sample's richness or phylogenetic diversity for a region. Third, applying a sequence mask to remove variable positions had a profound impact on genetic distances by muting the observed richness and phylogenetic diversity. Finally, the genetic distances calculated for each of the variable regions did a poor job of correlating with the full-length gene. Thus, while it is tempting to apply traditional cutoff levels derived for full-length sequences to these shorter sequences, it is not advisable. Analysis of beta-diversity metrics showed that each of these factors can have a significant impact on the comparison of community membership and structure. Taken together, these results urge caution in the design and interpretation of analyses using pyrosequencing data.}

	abstract = {The availability of hundreds of complete bacterial genomes has created new challenges and simultaneously opportunities for bioinformatics. In the area of statistical analysis of genomic sequences, the studies of nucleotide compositional bias and gene bias between strands and replichores paved way to the development of tools for prediction of bacterial replication origins. Only a few (about 20) origin regions for eubacteria and archaea have been proven experimentally. One reason for that may be that this is now considered as an essentially bioinformatics problem, where predictions are sufficiently reliable not to run labor-intensive experiments, unless specifically needed. Here we describe the main existing approaches to the identification of replication origin (oriC) and termination (terC) loci in prokaryotic chromosomes and characterize a number of computational tools based on various skew types and other types of evidence. We also classify the eubacterial and archaeal chromosomes by predictability of their replication origins using skew plots. Finally, we discuss possible combined approaches to the identification of the oriC sites that may be used to improve the prediction tools, in particular, the analysis of DnaA binding sites using the comparative genomic methods.}

	abstract = {The study of microbial diversity patterns is hampered by the enormous diversity of microbial communities and the lack of resources to sample them exhaustively. For many questions about richness and evenness, however, one only needs to know the relative order of diversity among samples rather than total diversity. We used 16S libraries from the Global Ocean Survey to investigate the ability of 10 diversity statistics (including rarefaction, non-parametric, parametric, curve extrapolation and diversity indices) to assess the relative diversity of six aquatic bacterial communities. Overall, we found that the statistics yielded remarkably similar rankings of the samples for a given sequence similarity cut-off. This correspondence, despite the different underlying assumptions of the statistics, suggests that diversity statistics are a useful tool for ranking samples of microbial diversity. In addition, sequence similarity cut-off influenced the diversity ranking of the samples, demonstrating that diversity statistics can also be used to detect differences in phylogenetic structure among microbial communities. Finally, a subsampling analysis suggests that further sequencing from these particular clone libraries would not have substantially changed the richness rankings of the samples.}

	abstract = {The largest part of the Earth's microbial biomass is stored in cold environments, which represent almost untapped reservoirs of novel species, processes, and genes. In this study, the first metagenomic survey of the metabolic potential and phylogenetic diversity of a microbial assemblage present in glacial ice is presented. DNA was isolated from glacial ice of the Northern Schneeferner, Germany. Pyrosequencing of this DNA yielded 1,076,539 reads (239.7 Mbp). The phylogenetic composition of the prokaryotic community was assessed by evaluation of a pyrosequencing-derived data set and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The Proteobacteria (mainly Betaproteobacteria), Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were the predominant phylogenetic groups. In addition, isolation of psychrophilic microorganisms was performed, and 13 different bacterial isolates were recovered. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates revealed that all were affiliated to the predominant groups. As expected for microorganisms residing in a low-nutrient environment, a high metabolic versatility with respect to degradation of organic substrates was detected by analysis of the pyrosequencing-derived data set. The presence of autotrophic microorganisms was indicated by identification of genes typical for different ways of carbon fixation. In accordance with the results of the phylogenetic studies, in which mainly aerobic and facultative aerobic bacteria were detected, genes typical for central metabolism of aerobes were found. Nevertheless, the capability of growth under anaerobic conditions was indicated by genes involved in dissimilatory nitrate/nitrite reduction. Numerous characteristics for metabolic adaptations associated with a psychrophilic lifestyle, such as formation of cryoprotectants and maintenance of membrane fluidity by the incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids, were detected. Thus, analysis of the glacial metagenome provided insights into the microbial life in frozen habitats on Earth, thereby possibly shedding light onto microbial life in analogous extraterrestrial environments.}

	abstract = {For comparison of whole-genome (genic + nongenic) sequences, multiple sequence alignment of a few selected genes is not appropriate. One approach is to use an alignment-free method in which feature (or l-mer) frequency profiles (FFP) of whole genomes are used for comparison-a variation of a text or book comparison method, using word frequency profiles. In this approach it is critical to identify the optimal resolution range of l-mers for the given set of genomes compared. The optimum FFP method is applicable for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions even when there are no common genes with high homology. We outline the method in 3 stages: (i) We first show how the optimal resolution range can be determined with English books which have been transformed into long character strings by removing all punctuation and spaces. (ii) Next, we test the robustness of the optimized FFP method at the nucleotide level, using a mutation model with a wide range of base substitutions and rearrangements. (iii) Finally, to illustrate the utility of the method, phylogenies are reconstructed from concatenated mammalian intronic genomes; the FFP derived intronic genome topologies for each l within the optimal range are all very similar. The topology agrees with the established mammalian phylogeny revealing that intron regions contain a similar level of phylogenic signal as do coding regions.}

	abstract = {Structural elements in RNA molecules have a distinct nucleotide composition, which changes gradually over evolutionary time. We discovered certain features of these compositional patterns that are shared between all RNA families. Based on this information, we developed a structure prediction method that evaluates candidate structures for a set of homologous RNAs on their ability to reproduce the patterns exhibited by biological structures. The method is named SPuNC for 'Structure Prediction using Nucleotide Composition'. In a performance test on a diverse set of RNA families we demonstrate that the SPuNC algorithm succeeds in selecting the most realistic structures in an ensemble. The average accuracy of top-scoring structures is significantly higher than the average accuracy of all ensemble members (improvements of more than 20\% observed). In addition, a consensus structure that includes the most reliable base pairs gleaned from a set of top-scoring structures is generally more accurate than a consensus derived from the full structural ensemble. Our method achieves better accuracy than existing methods on several RNA families, including novel riboswitches and ribozymes. The results clearly show that nucleotide composition can be used to reveal the quality of RNA structures and thus the presented technique should be added to the set of prediction tools.}

By adopting a massively parallel tag sequencing strategy, we show that bacterial communities of deep water masses of the North Atlantic and diffuse flow hydrothermal vents are one to two orders of magnitude more complex than previously reported for any microbial environment. A relatively small number of different populations dominate all samples, but thousands of low-abundance populations account for most of the observed phylogenetic diversity. This "rare biosphere" is very ancient and may represent a nearly inexhaustible source of genomic innovation.

Recording of the provenance of an experiment--what was done; where, how and why, etc. is an important aspect of scientific best practice that should be extended to in silico experimentation. We will do this in the context of eScience which has been part of the move of bioinformatics towards an industrial setting. Despite the computational nature of bioinformatics, these analyses are scientific and thus necessitate their own versions of typical scientific rigour. Just as recording who, what, why, when, where and how of an experiment is central to the scientific process in laboratory science, so it should be in silico science. The generation and recording of these aspects, or provenance, of an experiment are necessary knowledge management goals if we are to introduce scientific rigour into routine bioinformatics. In Silico experimental protocols should themselves be a form of managing the knowledge of how to perform bioinformatics analyses. Several systems now exist that offer support for the generation and collection of provenance information about how a particular in silico experiment was run, what results were generated, how they were generated, etc. In reviewing provenance support, we will review one of the important knowledge management issues in bioinformatics.}

Often, it is only the 'novel' sequences in a complex dataset that are of interest and the superfluous sequences need to be removed. RESULTS: A novel algorithm, FACS (Fast and Accurate Classification of Sequences), is introduced that can accurately and rapidly classify sequences as belonging or not belonging to a reference sequence. FACS was first optimized and validated using a synthetic metagenome dataset. An experimental metagenome dataset was then used to show that FACS achieves comparable accuracy as BLAT and SSAHA2 but is at least 21 times faster in classifying sequences.

Massively parallel pyrosequencing technology enables ultra-deep sequencing of complex microbial populations rapidly and inexpensively. However, computational methods for analyzing large collections of 16S ribosomal sequences are limited. We proposed a new algorithm, referred to as ESPRIT, which addresses several computational issues with prior methods. We developed two versions of ESPRIT, one for personal computers (PCs) and one for computer clusters (CCs). The PC version is used for small- and medium-scale data sets and can process several tens of thousands of sequences within a few minutes, while the CC version is for large-scale problems and is able to analyze several hundreds of thousands of reads within one day. Large-scale experiments are presented that clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm.

The bacterial component constitutes a community of high diversity, which appears to change in structure in response to disease events. In this study, we highlight the limitation of 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) clone library sequencing as the sole method to comprehensively describe coral-associated communities. This limitation was addressed by combining a high-density 16S rRNA gene microarray with, clone library sequencing as a novel approach to study bacterial communities in healthy versus diseased corals. We determined an increase in diversity as well as a significant shift in community structure in Montastraea faveolata colonies displaying phenotypic signs of White Plague Disease type II (WPD-II). An accumulation of species that belong to families that include known coral pathogens (Alteromonadaceae, Vibrionaceae), bacteria previously isolated from diseased, stressed or injured marine invertebrates (for example, Rhodobacteraceae), and other species (for example, Campylobacteraceae) was observed. Some of these species were also present in healthy tissue samples, but the putative primary pathogen, Aurantimonas corallicida, was not detected in any sample by either method. Although an ecological succession of bacteria during disease progression after causation by a primary agent represents a possible explanation for our observations, we also discuss the possibility that a disease of yet to be determined etiology may have affected M. faveolata colonies and resulted in (or be a result of) an increase in opportunistic pathogens.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 8 January 2009; doi:10.1038/ismej.2008.131.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The metagenomic analysis of microbial communities holds the potential to improve our understanding of the role of microbes in clinical conditions. Recent, dramatic improvements in DNA sequencing throughput and cost will enable such analyses on individuals. However, such advances in throughput generally come at the cost of shorter read-lengths, limiting the discriminatory power of each read. In particular, classifying the microbial content of samples by sequencing the < 1,600 bp 16S rRNA gene will be affected by such limitations. RESULTS: We describe a method for identifying the phylogenetic content of bacterial samples using high-throughput Pyrosequencing targeted at the 16S rRNA gene. Our analysis is adapted to the shorter read-lengths of such technology and uses a database of 16S rDNA to determine the most specific phylogenetic classification for reads, resulting in a weighted phylogenetic tree characterizing the content of the sample. We present results for six samples obtained from the human vagina during pregnancy that corroborates previous studies using conventional techniques.Next, we analyze the power of our method to classify reads at each level of the phylogeny using simulation experiments. We assess the impacts of read-length and database completeness on our method, and predict how we do as technology improves and more bacteria are sequenced. Finally, we study the utility of targeting specific 16S variable regions and show that such an approach considerably improves results for certain types of microbial samples. Using simulation, our method can be used to determine the most informative variable region. CONCLUSION: This study provides positive validation of the effectiveness of targeting 16S metagenomes using short-read sequencing technology. Our methodology allows us to infer the most specific assignment of the sequence reads within the phylogeny, and to identify the most discriminative variable region to target. The analysis of high-throughput Pyrosequencing on human flora samples will accelerate the study of the relationship between the microbial world and ourselves.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Although the extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in complete genomes has been widely studied, its influence in the evolution of natural communities of prokaryotes remains unknown. The availability of metagenomic sequences allows us to address the study of global patterns of prokaryotic evolution in samples from natural communities. However, the methods that have been commonly used for the study of HGT are not suitable for metagenomic samples. Therefore it is important to develop new methods or to adapt existing ones to be used with metagenomic sequences. RESULTS: We have created two different methods that are suitable for the study of HGT in metagenomic samples. The methods are based on phylogenetic and DNA compositional approaches, and have allowed us to assess the extent of possible HGT events in metagenomes for the first time. The methods are shown to be compatible and quite precise, although they probably underestimate the number of possible events. Our results show that the phylogenetic method detects HGT in between 0.8\% and 1.5\% of the sequences, while DNA compositional methods identify putative HGT in between 2\% and 8\% of the sequences. These ranges are very similar to these found in complete genomes by related approaches. Both methods act with a different sensitivity since they probably target HGT events of different ages: the compositional method mostly identifies recent transfers, while the phylogenetic is more suitable for the detections of older events. Nevertheless, the study of the number of HGT events in metagenomic sequences from different communities shows a consistent trend for both methods: the lower amount is found for the sequences of the Sargasso Sea metagenome, while the higher quantity is found in the whale fall metagenome from the bottom of the ocean. The significance of these observations is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The computational approaches that are used to find possible HGT events in complete genomes can be adapted to work with metagenomic samples, where a level of high performance is shown in different metagenomic samples. The percentage of possible HGT events that were observed is close to that found for complete genomes, and different microbiomes show diverse ratios of putative HGT events. This is probably related with both environmental factors and the composition in the species of each particular community.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing availability of gene sequences of prokaryotic species in samples extracted from all kind of locations allows addressing the study of the influence of environmental patterns in prokaryotic biodiversity. We present a comprehensive study to address the potential existence of environmental preferences of prokaryotic taxa and the commonness of the specialist and generalist strategies. We also assessed the most significant environmental factors shaping the environmental distribution of taxa. RESULTS: We used 16S rDNA sequences from 3,502 sampling experiments in natural and artificial sources. These sequences were taxonomically assigned, and the corresponding samples were also classified into a hierarchical classification of environments. We used several statistical methods to analyze the environmental distribution of taxa. Our results indicate that environmental specificity is not very common at the higher taxonomic levels (phylum to family), but emerges at lower taxonomic levels (genus and species). The most selective environmental characteristics are those of animal tissues and thermal locations. Salinity is another very important factor for constraining prokaryotic diversity. On the other hand, soil and freshwater habitats are the less restrictive environments, harboring the largest number of prokaryotic taxa. All information on taxa, samples and environments is provided at the envDB online database, http://metagenomics.uv.es/envDB. CONCLUSIONS: This is, as far as we know, the most comprehensive assessment of the distribution and diversity of prokaryotic taxa and their associations with different environments. Our data indicate that we are still far from characterizing prokaryotic diversity in any environment, except, perhaps, for human tissues such as the oral cavity and the vagina.}

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clones obtained by PCR from uncultured bacteria inhabiting a wide range of environments has increased our knowledge of bacterial diversity. One possible problem in the assessment of bacterial diversity based on sequence information is that PCR is exquisitely sensitive to contaminating 16S rDNA. This raises the possibility that some putative environmental rRNA sequences in fact correspond to contaminant sequences. To document potential contaminants, we cloned and sequenced PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments obtained at low levels in the absence of added template DNA. 16S rDNA sequences closely related to the genera Duganella (formerly Zoogloea), Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Escherichia, Leptothrix, and Herbaspirillum were identified in contaminant libraries and in clone libraries from diverse, generally low-biomass habitats. The rRNA sequences detected possibly are common contaminants in reagents used to prepare genomic DNA. Consequently, their detection in processed environmental samples may not reflect environmentally relevant organisms.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Markers for microbial groups are commonly measured in house dust samples to assess indoor exposure to microbes in studies on asthma and allergy. However, little is known about the sources of different microbes. A better understanding of the nature and origin of microbes present in the immediate environment of human beings is crucial if one wants to elucidate protective as well as adverse effects on human health. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which the bacterial composition of mattress and floor dust reflects the presence of the human body in relation to other environmental sources. METHODS: House dust and skin surface swab samples of occupants in 4 homes were collected and analyzed for their bacterial content, using a culture-independent methodology. Bacterial sequences analyzed from the different house dusts and skin surface swabs represented random samples of bacteria present in a given sample. Highly similar sequences were grouped to assess biodiversity and to draw conclusions about the sources of bacteria. RESULTS: The bacterial flora in the house dust samples was found to be highly diverse and dominated by gram-positive bacteria. To a considerable extent, the presence of different bacterial groups was attributed to human sources. In the individuals' mattress dust samples, 69\% to 88\% of the bacterial sequences analyzed were associated with human origins. The respective percentages for the individual floor dusts ranged from 45\% to 55\%. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that human-derived bacteria account for a large part of the mainly gram-positive bacterial content in house dust.}

This situation can be corrected by: (1) providing unified portals serving genomic data and (2) building Web applications to allow flexible retrieval and on-the-fly analyses of the data. Powerful resources, such as the UCSC Genome Browser already address the first issue. The second issue, however, remains open. For example, how to find human protein-coding exons with the highest density of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and extract orthologous sequences from all sequenced mammals? Indeed, one can access all relevant data from the UCSC Genome Browser. But once the data is downloaded how would one deal with millions of SNPs and gigabytes of alignments? Galaxy (http://g2.bx.psu.edu) is designed specifically for that purpose. It amplifies the strengths of existing resources (such as UCSC Genome Browser) by allowing the user to access and, most importantly, analyze data within a single interface in an unprecedented number of ways.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the emerging field of environmental genomics, direct cloning and sequencing of genomic fragments from complex microbial communities has proven to be a valuable source of new enzymes, expanding the knowledge of basic biological processes. The central problem of this so called metagenome-approach is that the cloned fragments often lack suitable phylogenetic marker genes, rendering the identification of clones that are likely to originate from the same genome difficult or impossible. In such cases, the analysis of intrinsic DNA-signatures like tetranucleotide frequencies can provide valuable hints on fragment affiliation. With this application in mind, the TETRA web-service and the TETRA stand-alone program have been developed, both of which automate the task of comparative tetranucleotide frequency analysis. Availability: http://www.megx.net/tetra. RESULTS: TETRA provides a statistical analysis of tetranucleotide usage patterns in genomic fragments, either via a web-service or a stand-alone program. With respect to discriminatory power, such an analysis outperforms the assignment of genomic fragments based on the (G+C)-content, which is a widely-used sequence-based measure for assessing fragment relatedness. While the web-service is restricted to the calculation of correlation coefficients between tetranucleotide usage patterns of submitted DNA sequences, the stand-alone program generates a much more detailed output, comprising all raw data and graphical plots. The stand-alone program is controlled via a graphical user interface and can batch-process a multitude of sequences. Furthermore, it comes with pre-computed tetranucleotide usage patterns for 166 prokaryote chromosomes, providing a useful reference dataset and source for data-mining. CONCLUSIONS: Up to now, the analysis of skewed oligonucleotide distributions within DNA sequences is not a commonly used tool within metagenomics. With the TETRA web-service and stand-alone program, the method is now accessible in an easy to use manner for a broad audience. This will hopefully facilitate the interrelation of genomic fragments from metagenome libraries, ultimately leading to new insights into the genetic potentials of yet uncultured microorganisms.}

	abstract = {A basic problem of the metagenomic approach in microbial ecology is the assignment of genomic fragments to a certain species or taxonomic group, when suitable marker genes are absent. Currently, the (G + C)-content together with phylogenetic information and codon adaptation for functional genes is mostly used to assess the relationship of different fragments. These methods, however, can produce ambiguous results. In order to evaluate sequence-based methods for fragment identification, we extensively compared (G + C)-contents and tetranucleotide usage patterns of 9054 fosmid-sized genomic fragments generated in silico from 118 completely sequenced bacterial genomes (40 982 931 fragment pairs were compared in total). The results of this systematic study show that the discriminatory power of correlations of tetranucleotide-derived z-scores is by far superior to that of differences in (G + C)-content and provides reasonable assignment probabilities when applied to metagenome libraries of small diversity. Using six fully sequenced fosmid inserts from a metagenomic analysis of microbial consortia mediating the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), we demonstrate that discrimination based on tetranucleotide-derived z-score correlations was consistent with corresponding data from 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis and allowed us to discriminate between fosmid inserts that were indistinguishable with respect to their (G + C)-contents.}

	abstract = {The human microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms, including prokaryotes, viruses, and microbial eukaryotes, that populate the human body. The National Institutes of Health launched an initiative that focuses on describing the diversity of microbial species that are associated with health and disease. The first phase of this initiative includes the sequencing of hundreds of microbial reference genomes, coupled to metagenomic sequencing from multiple body sites. Here we present results from an initial reference genome sequencing of 178 microbial genomes. From 547,968 predicted polypeptides that correspond to the gene complement of these strains, previously unidentified ("novel") polypeptides that had both unmasked sequence length greater than 100 amino acids and no BLASTP match to any nonreference entry in the nonredundant subset were defined. This analysis resulted in a set of 30,867 polypeptides, of which 29,987 (~97\%) were unique. In addition, this set of microbial genomes allows for ~40\% of random sequences from the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract to be associated with organisms based on the match criteria used. Insights into pan-genome analysis suggest that we are still far from saturating microbial species genetic data sets. In addition, the associated metrics and standards used by our group for quality assurance are presented.}

The simple morphology of most microbes provides few clues for their identification and physiological traits are often ambiguous. In addition, many organisms resist cultivation, which is essential to their characterization. Recombinant DNA techniques have provided a means whereby many of the obstacles associated with cultivation and description can be overcome and subsequently has allowed many new insights into the complexity of natural microbial communities. Molecular approaches based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence analysis allow direct investigation of the community structure, diversity, and phylogeny of microorganisms in almost any environment, while quantification of the individual types of microorganisms or entire microbial communities may be addressed by nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Furthermore, the use of fluorescently labeled population-specific rRNA probes allows microscopic examination of individual cells in complex microbial assemblages as well as their interactions in situ. In this review, we discuss strategies for characterizing microbial communities without the need for cultivation.}

Many species are difficult to study in isolation because they fail to grow in laboratory culture, depend on other organisms for critical processes, or have become extinct.

Here we characterize and compare the metabolic capabilities of terrestrial and marine microbial communities using largely unassembled sequence data obtained by shotgun sequencing DNA isolated from the various environments. Quantitative gene content analysis reveals habitat-specific fingerprints that reflect known characteristics of the sampled environments. The identification of environment-specific genes through a gene-centric comparative analysis presents new opportunities for interpreting and diagnosing environments.}

More recently this approach has been overshadowed by metagenomics, which provides a global overview of a community's functional potential rather than just an inventory of its inhabitants. However, the pioneering 16S rRNA gene is making a comeback in its own right thanks to a number of methodological advancements including higher resolution (more sequences), analysis of multiple related samples (e.g. spatial and temporal series) and improved metadata, and use of metadata. The standard conclusion that microbial ecosystems are remarkably complex and diverse is now being replaced by detailed insights into microbial ecology and evolution based only on this one historically important marker gene.}

	abstract = {In recent years, the increase in the amounts of available genomic data has made it easier to appreciate the extent by which organisms increase their genetic diversity through horizontally transferred genetic material. Such transfers have the potential to give rise to extremely dynamic genomes where a significant proportion of their coding DNA has been contributed by external sources. Because of the impact of these horizontal transfers on the ecological and pathogenic character of the recipient organisms, methods are continuously sought that are able to computationally determine which of the genes of a given genome are products of transfer events. In this paper, we introduce and discuss a novel computational method for identifying horizontal transfers that relies on a gene's nucleotide composition and obviates the need for knowledge of codon boundaries. In addition to being applicable to individual genes, the method can be easily extended to the case of clusters of horizontally transferred genes. With the help of an extensive and carefully designed set of experiments on 123 archaeal and bacterial genomes, we demonstrate that the new method exhibits significant improvement in sensitivity when compared to previously published approaches. In fact, it achieves an average relative improvement across genomes of between 11 and 41\% compared to the Codon Adaptation Index method in distinguishing native from foreign genes. Our method's horizontal gene transfer predictions for 123 microbial genomes are available online at http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/HGT/.}

Using a new scheme for noise reduction in pyrosequencing data, we estimated the total diversity of species-level bacterial phylotypes in the 1.2-1.5 million bacterial 16S rRNA reads obtained from each deeply sampled cotwin to be approximately 800 (35.9\%, 49.1\% detected in both). A combined 1.1 million read 16S rRNA dataset representing 281 shallowly sequenced fecal samples from 54 twin pairs and their mothers contained an estimated 4,018 species-level phylotypes, with each sample having a unique species assemblage (53.4 +/- 0.6\% and 50.3 +/- 0.5\% overlap with the deeply sampled cotwins). Of the 134 phylotypes with a relative abundance of >0.1\% in the combined dataset, only 37 appeared in >50\% of the samples, with one phylotype in the Lachnospiraceae family present in 99\%. Nongut communities had significantly reduced overlap with the deeply sequenced twins' fecal microbiota (18.3 +/- 0.3\%, 15.3 +/- 0.3\%). The MZ cotwins' fecal DNA was deeply sequenced (3.8-6.3 Gbp/sample) and assembled reads were assigned to 25 genus-level phylogenetic bins. Only 17\% of the genes in these bins were shared between the cotwins. Bins exhibited differences in their degree of sequence variation, gene content including the repertoire of carbohydrate active enzymes present within and between twins (e.g., predicted cellulases, dockerins), and transcriptional activities. These results provide an expanded perspective about features that make each of us unique life forms and directions for future characterization of our gut ecosystems.}

	abstract = {Microbial communities are vital in the functioning of all ecosystems; however, most microorganisms are uncultivated, and their roles in natural systems are unclear. Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.}

	abstract = {Analysis of assembled random shotgun sequence data from a low-diversity, subsurface acid mine drainage (AMD) biofilm revealed a single nif operon. This was found on a genome fragment belonging to a member of Leptospirillum group III, a lineage in the Nitrospirae phylum with no cultivated representatives. Based on the prediction that this organism is solely responsible for nitrogen fixation in the community, we pursued a selective isolation strategy to obtain the organism in pure culture. An AMD biofilm sample naturally abundant in Leptospirillum group III cells was homogenized, filtered, and serially diluted into a nitrogen-free liquid medium. The resulting culture in the terminal dilution grew autotrophically to a maximum cell density of approximately 10(6) cells/ml, oxidizing ferrous iron as the sole energy source. 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer region clone library analysis confirmed that the isolate is a member of Leptospirillum group III and that the culture is axenic. We propose the name Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum sp. nov. for this iron-oxidizing, free-living diazotroph. This study highlights how environmental sequence data can provide insights for culturing previously uncultured microorganisms.}

Although an isolate traditionally has been required for genomic characterization, the advent of sequencing of entire natural microbial communities enables culture-independent genomic analysis. Information about the genetic potential of uncultivated organisms can be used to predict the form of metabolic interdependencies and nutritional requirements. We believe that this could provide the information necessary to bypass bottlenecks that have inhibited cultivation of many microorganisms. However, it might not be practical or possible to isolate all of the vast number of microbial species and strains for laboratory-based characterization. Ultimately, cultivation-independent genomic and genomically enabled approaches could provide a way to directly analyze microbial activity in its geochemical and ecological context.}

	abstract = {One of the first steps in characterizing an ecosystem is to describe the organisms inhabiting it. For microbial studies, experimental limitations have hindered the ability to depict diverse communities. Here we describe oligonucleotide fingerprinting of rRNA genes (OFRG), a method that permits identification of arrayed rRNA genes (rDNA) through a series of hybridization experiments using small DNA probes. To demonstrate this strategy, we examined the bacteria inhabiting two different soils. Analysis of 1,536 rDNA clones revealed 766 clusters grouped into five major taxa: Bacillus, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and two undefined assemblages. Soil-specific taxa were identified and then independently confirmed through cluster-specific PCR of the original soil DNA. Near-species-level resolution was obtained by this analysis as clones with average sequence identities of 97\% were grouped in the same cluster. A comparison of these OFRG results with the results obtained in a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the same two soils demonstrated the significance of this methodological advance. OFRG provides a cost-effective means to extensively analyze microbial communities and should have applications in medicine, biotechnology, and ecosystem studies.}

	abstract = {The detailed descriptions now available for the secondary structure of small-ribosomal-subunit RNA, including areas of highly variable primary structure, facilitate the alignment of nucleotide sequences. However, for optimal exploitation of the information contained in the alignment, a method must be available that takes into account the local sequence variability in the computation of evolutionary distance. A quantitative definition for the variability of an alignment position is proposed in this study. It is a parameter in an equation which expresses the probability that the alignment position contains a different nucleotide in two sequences, as a function of the distance separating these sequences, i.e., the number of substitutions per nucleotide that occurred during their divergence. This parameter can be estimated from the distance matrix resulting from the conversion of pairwise sequence dissimilarities into pairwise distances. Alignment positions can then be subdivided into a number of sets of matching variability, and the average variability of each set can be derived. Next, the conversion of dissimilarity into distance can be recalculated for each set of alignment positions separately, using a modified version of the equation that corrects for multiple substitutions and changing for each set the parameter that reflects its average variability. The distances computed for each set are finally averaged, giving a more precise distance estimation. Trees constructed by the algorithm based on variability calibration have a topology markedly different from that of trees constructed from the same alignments in the absence of calibration. This is illustrated by means of trees constructed from small-ribosomal-subunit RNA sequences of Metazoa. A reconstruction of vertebrate evolution based on calibrated alignments matches the consensus view of paleontologists, contrary to trees based on uncalibrated alignments. In trees derived from sequences covering several metazoan phyla, artefacts in topology that are probably due to a high clock rate in certain lineages are avoided.}

Evol. 42, 201-210] was applied to bacterial 16S, 5S and 23S rRNAs. In this method, the variability of each nucleotide site is defined as its evolutionary rate relative to the average evolutionary rate of all the nucleotide sites of the molecule. Spectra of evolutionary rates were calculated for each rRNA and show the fastest evolving sites substituting at rates more than 1000 times that of the slowest ones. Variability maps are presented for each rRNA, consisting of secondary structure models where the variability of each nucleotide site is indicated by means of a colored dot. The maps can be interpreted in terms of higher order structure, function and evolution of the molecules and facilitate the selection of areas suitable for the design of PCR primers and hybridization probes. Variability measurement is also important for the precise estimation of evolutionary distances and the inference of phylogenetic trees.}

	abstract = {Chlorarachniophytes are amoeboid algae with chlorophyll a and b containing plastids that are surrounded by four membranes instead of two as in plants and green algae. These extra membranes form important support for the hypothesis that chlorarachniophytes have acquired their plastids by the ingestion of another eukaryotic plastid-containing alga. Chlorarachniophytes also contain a small nucleus-like structure called the nucleomorph situated between the two inner and the two outer membranes surrounding the plastid. This nucleomorph is a remnant of the endosymbiont's nucleus and encodes, among other molecules, small subunit ribosomal RNA. Previous phylogenetic analyses on the basis of this molecule provided unexpected and contradictory evidence for the origin of the chlorarachniophyte endosymbiont. We developed a new method for measuring the substitution rates of the individual nucleotides of small subunit ribosomal RNA. From the resulting substitution rate distribution, we derived an equation that gives a more realistic relationship between sequence dissimilarity and evolutionary distance than equations previously available. Phylogenetic trees constructed on the basis of evolutionary distances computed by this new method clearly situate the chlorarachniophyte nucleomorphs among the green algae. Moreover, this relationship is confirmed by transversion analysis of the Chlorarachnion plastid small subunit ribosomal RNA.}

	abstract = {In this study we constructed a bootstrapped distance tree of 500 small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences from organisms belonging to the so-called crown of eukaryote evolution. Taking into account the substitution rate of the individual nucleotides of the rRNA sequence alignment, our results suggest that (1) animals, true fungi, and choanoflagellates share a common origin: The branch joining these taxa is highly supported by bootstrap analysis (bootstrap support [BS] > 90\%), (2) stramenopiles and alveolates are sister groups (BS = 75\%), (3) within the alveolates, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans share a common ancestor BS > 95\%), while in turn they both share a common origin with the ciliates (BS > 80\%), and (4) within the stramenopiles, heterokont algae, hyphochytriomycetes, and oomycetes form a monophyletic grouping well supported by bootstrap analysis (BS > 85\%), preceded by the well-supported successive divergence of labyrinthulomycetes and bicosoecids.On the other hand, many evolutionary relationships between crown taxa are still obscure on the basis of 18S rRNA. The branching order between the animal-fungal-choanoflagellates clade and the chlorobionts, the alveolates and stramenopiles, red algae, and several smaller groups of organisms remains largely unresolved.When among-site rate variation is not considered, the inferred tree topologies are inferior to those where the substitution rate spectrum for the 18S rRNA is taken into account. This is primarily indicated by the erroneous branching of fast-evolving sequences. Moreover, when different substitution rates among sites are not considered, the animals no longer appear as a monophyletic grouping in most distance trees.}

	abstract = {Recent experience with molecular phylogeny has shown that all molecular markers have strengths and weaknesses. Nonetheless, despite several notable discrepancies with phylogenies obtained from protein data, the merits of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) as a molecular phylogenetic marker remain indisputable. Over the last 10 to 15 years a massive SSU rRNA database has been gathered, including more then 3000 complete sequences from eukaryotes. This creates a huge computational challenge, which is exacerbated by phenomena such as extensive rate variation among sites in the molecule. A few years ago, a fast phylogenetic method was developed that takes into account among-site rate variation in the estimation of evolutionary distances. This "substitution rate calibration" (SRC) method not only corrects for a major source of artifacts in phylogeny reconstruction but, because it is based on a distance approach, allows comprehensive trees including thousands of sequences to be constructed in a reasonable amount of time. In this study, a nucleotide variability map and a phylogenetic tree were constructed, using the SRC method, based on all available (January 2000) complete SSU rRNA sequences (2551) for species belonging to the so-called eukaryotic crown. The resulting phylogeny constitutes the most complete description of overall eukaryote diversity and relationships to date. Furthermore, branch lengths estimated with the SRC method better reflect the huge differences in evolutionary rates among and within eukaryotic lineages. The ribosomal RNA tree is compared with a recent protein phylogeny obtained from concatenated actin, alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, and elongation factor 1-alpha amino acid sequences. A consensus phylogeny of the eukaryotic crown based on currently available molecular data is discussed, as well as specific problems encountered in analyzing sequences when large differences in substitution rate are present, either between different sequences (rate variation among lineages) or between different positions within the same sequence (among-site rate variation).}

	abstract = {We developed single-point genome signature tags (SP-GSTs), a generally applicable, high-throughput sequencing-based method that targets specific genes to generate identifier tags from well-defined points in a genome. The technique yields identifier tags that can distinguish between closely related bacterial strains and allow for the identification of microbial community members. SP-GSTs are determined by three parameters: (i) the primer designed to recognize a conserved gene sequence, (ii) the anchoring enzyme recognition sequence, and (iii) the type IIS restriction enzyme which defines the tag length. We evaluated the SP-GST method in silico for bacterial identification using the genes rpoC, uvrB, and recA and the 16S rRNA gene. The best distinguishing tags were obtained with the restriction enzyme Csp6I upstream of the 16S rRNA gene, which discriminated all organisms in our data set to at least the genus level and most organisms to the species level. The method was successfully used to generate Csp6I-based tags upstream of the 16S rRNA gene and allowed us to discriminate between closely related strains of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. This concept was further used successfully to identify the individual members of a defined microbial community.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the increased availability of sequenced genomes there have been several initiatives to infer evolutionary relationships by whole genome characteristics. One of these studies suggested good congruence between genome synteny, shared gene content, 16S ribosomal DNA identity, codon usage and the genome signature in prokaryotes. Here we rigorously test the phylogenetic signal of the genome signature, which consists of the genome-specific relative frequencies of dinucleotides, on 334 sequenced prokaryotic genome sequences. RESULTS: Intrageneric comparisons show that in general the genomic dissimilarity scores are higher than in intraspecific comparisons, in accordance with the suggested phylogenetic signal of the genome signature. Exceptions to this trend, (Bartonella spp., Bordetella spp., Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp.), which have low average intrageneric genomic dissimilarity scores, suggest that members of these genera might be considered the same species. On the other hand, high genomic dissimilarity values for intraspecific analyses suggest that in some cases (e.g.Prochlorococcus marinus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Buchnera aphidicola and Rhodopseudomonas palustris) different strains from the same species may actually represent different species. Comparing 16S rDNA identity with genomic dissimilarity values corroborates the previously suggested trend in phylogenetic signal, albeit that the dissimilarity values only provide low resolution. CONCLUSION: The genome signature has a distinct phylogenetic signal, independent of individual genetic marker genes. A reliable phylogenetic clustering cannot be based on dissimilarity values alone, as bootstrapping is not possible for this parameter. It can however be used to support or refute a given phylogeny and resulting taxonomy.}

Here we examine the positions of mononucleotide repeats within microbial genes and detect a pervasive bias in the locations of these disruptive elements that becomes more pronounced with increases in repeat length. We argue that, because these repeats are mutagenic, this pattern arose to minimize the costs associated with transcribing and translating nonfunctional genes, supporting a view that pseudogenes need not be evolving in a strictly neutral manner.}

	abstract = {Over the last 25 years, a much broader range of taxonomic studies of bacteria has gradually replaced the former reliance upon morphological, physiological, and biochemical characterization. This polyphasic taxonomy takes into account all available phenotypic and genotypic data and integrates them in a consensus type of classification, framed in a general phylogeny derived from 16S rRNA sequence analysis. In some cases, the consensus classification is a compromise containing a minimum of contradictions. It is thought that the more parameters that will become available in the future, the more polyphasic classification will gain stability. In this review, the practice of polyphasic taxonomy is discussed for four groups of bacteria chosen for their relevance, complexity, or both: the genera Xanthomonas and Campylobacter, the lactic acid bacteria, and the family Comamonadaceae. An evaluation of our present insights, the conclusions derived from it, and the perspectives of polyphasic taxonomy are discussed, emphasizing the keystone role of the species. Taxonomists did not succeed in standardizing species delimitation by using percent DNA hybridization values. Together with the absence of another "gold standard" for species definition, this has an enormous repercussion on bacterial taxonomy. This problem is faced in polyphasic taxonomy, which does not depend on a theory, a hypothesis, or a set of rules, presenting a pragmatic approach to a consensus type of taxonomy, integrating all available data maximally. In the future, polyphasic taxonomy will have to cope with (i) enormous amounts of data, (ii) large numbers of strains, and (iii) data fusion (data aggregation), which will demand efficient and centralized data storage. In the future, taxonomic studies will require collaborative efforts by specialized laboratories even more than now is the case. Whether these future developments will guarantee a more stable consensus classification remains an open question.}

This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for someone else to obtain the same results. In our experience, it is often even worse as even we are not always able to reproduce our own experiments, making it difficult to answer questions from colleagues about details. Following are some examples of e-mails we have received: "I just read your paper X. It is very completely described, however I am confused by Y.

These data are estimated to derive from at least 1800 genomic species based on sequence relatedness, including 148 previously unknown bacterial phylotypes. We have identified over 1.2 million previously unknown genes represented in these samples, including more than 782 new rhodopsin-like photoreceptors.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: There is a growing literature on the detection of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) events by means of parametric, non-comparative methods. Such approaches rely only on sequence information and utilize different low and high order indices to capture compositional deviation from the genome backbone; the superiority of the latter over the former has been shown elsewhere. However even high order k-mers may be poor estimators of HGT, when insufficient information is available, e.g. in short sliding windows. Most of the current HGT prediction methods require pre-existing annotation, which may restrict their application on newly sequenced genomes. RESULTS: We introduce a novel computational method, Interpolated Variable Order Motifs (IVOMs), which exploits compositional biases using variable order motif distributions and captures more reliably the local composition of a sequence compared with fixed-order methods. For optimal localization of the boundaries of each predicted region, a second order, two-state hidden Markov model (HMM) is implemented in a change-point detection framework. We applied the IVOM approach to the genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18, a well-studied prokaryote in terms of HGT events, and we show that the IVOMs outperform state-of-the-art low and high order motif methods predicting not only the already characterized Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI-1 to SPI-10) but also three novel SPIs (SPI-15, SPI-16, SPI-17) and other HGT events.

Despite intensive investigations and the rapid accumulation of sequence data, the causes of these a priori different genome biases have not been agreed on and seem multifactorial and idiosyncratic. We show that these biases can arise generically from an instability of the coevolutionary dynamics between genome composition and resource allocation for translation, transcription, and replication. Thus, we offer a unifying framework for understanding and analyzing different genome biases. We develop a test of multistability of nucleotide composition of completely sequenced genomes and reveal a bistability for Borrelia burgdorferi, a genome with pronounced replication-related biases. These results indicate that evolution generates rhetoric, it improves the efficiency of the genome's communication with the cell without modifying the message, and this leads to bias.}

	abstract = {An RNA virus population does not consist of a single genotype; rather, it is an ensemble of related sequences, termed quasispecies. Quasispecies arise from rapid genomic evolution powered by the high mutation rate of RNA viral replication. Although a high mutation rate is dangerous for a virus because it results in nonviable individuals, it has been hypothesized that high mutation rates create a 'cloud' of potentially beneficial mutations at the population level, which afford the viral quasispecies a greater probability to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection. Mathematical models predict that viral quasispecies are not simply a collection of diverse mutants but a group of interactive variants, which together contribute to the characteristics of the population. According to this view, viral populations, rather than individual variants, are the target of evolutionary selection. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the consequences of limiting genomic diversity on viral populations. We find that poliovirus carrying a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates less genomic diversity and is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions. In infected animals, the reduced viral diversity leads to loss of neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Notably, using chemical mutagenesis to expand quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity virus before infection restores neurotropism and pathogenesis. Analysis of viruses isolated from brain provides direct evidence for complementation between members in the quasispecies, indicating that selection indeed occurs at the population level rather than on individual variants. Our study provides direct evidence for a fundamental prediction of the quasispecies theory and establishes a link between mutation rate, population dynamics and pathogenesis.}

We exploited the metagenome of a mixed microbial population for isolation of more than 15 different genes encoding novel biocatalysts by using a combined cultivation and direct cloning strategy. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of hitherto uncultured microbes closely related to the genera Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Xanthomonas, Microbulbifer, and Janthinobacterium. Total genomic DNA from this bacterial community was used to construct cosmid DNA libraries, which were functionally searched for novel enzymes of biotechnological value. Our searches in combination with cosmid sequencing resulted in identification of four clones encoding 12 putative agarase genes, most of which were organized in clusters consisting of two or three genes. Interestingly, nine of these agarase genes probably originated from gene duplications. Furthermore, we identified by DNA sequencing several other biocatalyst-encoding genes, including genes encoding a putative stereoselective amidase (amiA), two cellulases (gnuB and uvs080), an alpha-amylase (amyA), a 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (amyB), and two pectate lyases (pelA and uvs119). Also, a conserved cluster of two lipase genes was identified, which was linked to genes encoding a type I secretion system. The novel gene aguB was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme activities were determined. Finally, we describe more than 162 kb of DNA sequence that provides a strong platform for further characterization of this microbial consortium.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered a strong evolutionary force shaping the content of microbial genomes in a substantial manner. It is the difference in speed enabling the rapid adaptation to changing environmental demands that distinguishes HGT from gene genesis, duplications or mutations. For a precise characterization, algorithms are needed that identify transfer events with high reliability. Frequently, the transferred pieces of DNA have a considerable length, comprise several genes and are called genomic islands (GIs) or more specifically pathogenicity or symbiotic islands. RESULTS: We have implemented the program SIGI-HMM that predicts GIs and the putative donor of each individual alien gene. It is based on the analysis of codon usage (CU) of each individual gene of a genome under study. CU of each gene is compared against a carefully selected set of CU tables representing microbial donors or highly expressed genes. Multiple tests are used to identify putatively alien genes, to predict putative donors and to mask putatively highly expressed genes. Thus, we determine the states and emission probabilities of an inhomogeneous hidden Markov model working on gene level. For the transition probabilities, we draw upon classical test theory with the intention of integrating a sensitivity controller in a consistent manner. SIGI-HMM was written in JAVA and is publicly available. It accepts as input any file created according to the embl-format. It generates output in the common GFF format readable for genome browsers. Benchmark tests showed that the output of SIGI-HMM is in agreement with known findings. Its predictions were both consistent with annotated GIs and with predictions generated by different methods. CONCLUSIONS: SIGI-HMM is a sensitive tool for the identification of GIs in microbial genomes. It allows to interactively analyze genomes in detail and to generate or to test hypotheses about the origin of acquired genes.}

It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence (> or = 95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.}

	abstract = {rRNA genes are thought unlikely to be laterally transferred, because rRNA must coevolve with a large number of cellular components to form the highly sophisticated translation apparatus and perform protein synthesis. In this paper, the authors first hypothesized that lateral gene transfer (LGT) might occur to rRNA genes via replacement of gene segments encoding individual domains of rRNA: the 'simplified complexity hypothesis'. Comparative sequence analyses of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes from a large number of actinomycete species frequently identified rRNA genes containing short segments with an abnormally high number of non-random base variations. These variations were nearly always characterized by complementing covariations of several paired bases within the stem of a hairpin. The nature of these base variations is not consistent with random mutations but satisfies well the predictions of the 'simplified complexity hypothesis'. The most parsimonious explanation for this phenomenon is the lateral transfer of rRNA gene segments between different bacterial species. This mode of LCT may create mosaic rRNA genes and occur repeatedly in different regions of a gene, gradually destroying the evolutionary history recorded in the nucleotide sequence.}

	abstract = {Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicons have been widely used in the classification of uncultured bacteria inhabiting environmental niches. Primers targeting conservative regions of the rDNAs are used to generate amplicons of variant regions that are informative in taxonomic assignment. One problem is that the percentage coverage and application scope of the primers used in previous studies are largely unknown. In this study, conservative fragments of available rDNA sequences were first mined and then used to search for candidate primers within the fragments by measuring the coverage rate defined as the percentage of bacterial sequences containing the target. Thirty predicted primers with a high coverage rate (>90\%) were identified, which were basically located in the same conservative regions as known primers in previous reports, whereas 30\% of the known primers were associated with a coverage rate of <90\%. The application scope of the primers was also examined by calculating the percentages of failed detections in bacterial phyla. Primers A519-539, E969-983, E1063-1081, U515 and E517, are highly recommended because of their high coverage in almost all phyla. As expected, the three predominant phyla, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes and Proteobacteria, are best covered by the predicted primers. The primers recommended in this report shall facilitate a comprehensive and reliable survey of bacterial diversity in metagenomic studies.}

	abstract = {From the standpoints of both basic research and biotechnology, there is considerable interest in reaching a clearer understanding of the diversity of biological mechanisms employed during lignocellulose degradation. Globally, termites are an extremely successful group of wood-degrading organisms and are therefore important both for their roles in carbon turnover in the environment and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for efforts aimed at converting wood into biofuels. Only recently have data supported any direct role for the symbiotic bacteria in the gut of the termite in cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Here we use a metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community resident in the hindgut paunch of a wood-feeding 'higher' Nasutitermes species (which do not contain cellulose-fermenting protozoa) to show the presence of a large, diverse set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Many of these genes were expressed in vivo or had cellulase activity in vitro, and further analyses implicate spirochete and fibrobacter species in gut lignocellulose degradation. New insights into other important symbiotic functions including H(2) metabolism, CO(2)-reductive acetogenesis and N(2) fixation are also provided by this first system-wide gene analysis of a microbial community specialized towards plant lignocellulose degradation. Our results underscore how complex even a 1-mul environment can be.}

A three-way genome comparison of the CFT073, enterohemorrhagic E. coli EDL933, and laboratory strain MG1655 reveals that, amazingly, only 39.2\% of their combined (nonredundant) set of proteins actually are common to all three strains. The pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain. The difference in disease potential between O157:H7 and CFT073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type III secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic E. coli. The CFT073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins, autotransporters, iron-sequestration systems, and phase-switch recombinases. Striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of CFT073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic E. coli strains, J96 and 536. Comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages. The different E. coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common, vertically evolved genes, whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain.}

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that dinucleotide abundances capture the majority of variation in genome signatures and are useful for quantifying lateral gene transfer and building molecular phylogenies. Metagenomes contain a mixture of individual genomes, and might be expected to lack compositional signatures. In many metagenomic data sets the majority of sequences have no significant similarities to known sequences and are effectively excluded from subsequent analyses. To circumvent this limitation, di-, tri- and tetranucleotide abundances of 86 microbial and viral metagenomes consisting of short pyrosequencing reads were analysed to provide a method which includes all sequences that can be used in combination with other analysis to increase our knowledge about microbial and viral communities. Both principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering showed definitive groupings of metagenomes drawn from similar environments. Together these analyses showed that dinucleotide composition, as opposed to tri- and tetranucleotides, defines a metagenomic signature which can explain up to 80\% of the variance between biomes, which is comparable to that obtained by functional genomics. Metagenomes with anomalous content were also identified using dinucleotide abundances. Subsequent analyses determined that these metagenomes were contaminated with exogenous DNA, suggesting that this approach is a useful metric for quality control. The predictive strength of the dinucleotide composition also opens the possibility of assigning ecological classifications to unknown fragments. Environmental selection may be responsible for this dinucleotide signature through direct selection of specific compositional signals; however, simulations suggest that the environment may select indirectly by promoting the increased abundance of a few dominant taxa.}

This variation includes large-scale differences in gene content between ecosystems as well as within-population sequence heterogeneity. In the present review, we focus specifically on how fine-scale variation within microbial and viral populations is apparent from community genomic data. A major unresolved question is how much of the observed variation is due to neutral vs. adaptive processes. Limited experimental data hint that some of this fine-scale variation may be in part functionally relevant, whereas sequence-based and modeling analyses suggest that much of it may be neutral. While methods for interpreting population genomic data are still in their infancy, we discuss current interpretations of existing datasets in the light of evolutionary processes and models. Finally, we highlight the importance of virus-host dynamics in generating and shaping within-population diversity.}

	abstract = {Obtaining an unbiased view of the phylogenetic composition and functional diversity within a microbial community is one central objective of metagenomic analysis. New technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have dramatically reduced sequencing costs to a level where metagenomic analysis may become a viable alternative to more focused assessments of the phylogenetic (eg. 16S rDNA) and functional diversity of microbial communities. To determine whether the short ( approximately 100-200 bp) sequence reads obtained from pyrosequencing are appropriate for phylogenetic and functional characterization of microbial communities the results of BLAST and COG analyses were compared for long ( approximately 750 bp) and randomly derived short reads from each of two microbial and one virioplankton metagenome libraries. Overall, BLASTX searches against GenBank nr found far fewer homologs within the short sequence library. This was especially pronounced for a Chesapeake Bay virioplankton metagenome library. Increasing the short read sampling depth or the length of derived short reads (up to 400 bp) did not completely resolve the discrepancy in BLASTX homolog detection. Only in cases where the long read sequence had a close homolog (low BLAST E-score) did the derived short read sequence also find a significant homolog. Thus, more distant homologs of microbial and viral genes are not detected by short read sequences. Among COG hits, derived short reads sampled at a depth of two short reads per long read missed up to 72\% of the COGs found using long reads. Noting the current limitation in computational approaches for analysis of short sequences, use of short read length libraries does not appear to be an appropriate tool for metagenomic characterization of microbial communities.}

	abstract = {Symbioses between bacteria and eukaryotes are ubiquitous, yet our understanding of the interactions driving these associations is hampered by our inability to cultivate most host-associated microbes. Here we use a metagenomic approach to describe four co-occurring symbionts from the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis, a worm lacking a mouth, gut and nephridia. Shotgun sequencing and metabolic pathway reconstruction revealed that the symbionts are sulphur-oxidizing and sulphate-reducing bacteria, all of which are capable of carbon fixation, thus providing the host with multiple sources of nutrition. Molecular evidence for the uptake and recycling of worm waste products by the symbionts suggests how the worm could eliminate its excretory system, an adaptation unique among annelid worms. We propose a model that describes how the versatile metabolism within this symbiotic consortium provides the host with an optimal energy supply as it shuttles between the upper oxic and lower anoxic coastal sediments that it inhabits.}

	abstract = {Comparative analysis of small-subunit ribosomal RNA (ss-rRNA) gene sequences forms the basis for much of what we know about the phylogenetic diversity of both cultured and uncultured microorganisms. As sequencing costs continue to decline and throughput increases, sequences of ss-rRNA genes are being obtained at an ever-increasing rate. This increasing flow of data has opened many new windows into microbial diversity and evolution, and at the same time has created significant methodological challenges. Those processes which commonly require time-consuming human intervention, such as the preparation of multiple sequence alignments, simply cannot keep up with the flood of incoming data. Fully automated methods of analysis are needed. Notably, existing automated methods avoid one or more steps that, though computationally costly or difficult, we consider to be important. In particular, we regard both the building of multiple sequence alignments and the performance of high quality phylogenetic analysis to be necessary. We describe here our fully-automated ss-rRNA taxonomy and alignment pipeline (STAP). It generates both high-quality multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, and thus can be used for multiple purposes including phylogenetically-based taxonomic assignments and analysis of species diversity in environmental samples. The pipeline combines publicly-available packages (PHYML, BLASTN and CLUSTALW) with our automatic alignment, masking, and tree-parsing programs. Most importantly, this automated process yields results comparable to those achievable by manual analysis, yet offers speed and capacity that are unattainable by manual efforts.}

	abstract = {Sequencing of bacterial and archaeal genomes has revolutionized our understanding of the many roles played by microorganisms. There are now nearly 1,000 completed bacterial and archaeal genomes available, most of which were chosen for sequencing on the basis of their physiology. As a result, the perspective provided by the currently available genomes is limited by a highly biased phylogenetic distribution. To explore the value added by choosing microbial genomes for sequencing on the basis of their evolutionary relationships, we have sequenced and analysed the genomes of 56 culturable species of Bacteria and Archaea selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage. Analysis of these genomes demonstrated pronounced benefits (compared to an equivalent set of genomes randomly selected from the existing database) in diverse areas including the reconstruction of phylogenetic history, the discovery of new protein families and biological properties, and the prediction of functions for known genes from other organisms. Our results strongly support the need for systematic 'phylogenomic' efforts to compile a phylogeny-driven 'Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea' in order to derive maximum knowledge from existing microbial genome data as well as from genome sequences to come.}

Here we present a study of methods for surveying bacterial communities in human feces using 454/Roche pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags. We analyzed fecal samples from 10 individuals and compared methods for storage, DNA purification and sequence acquisition. To assess reproducibility, we compared samples one cm apart on a single stool specimen for each individual. To analyze storage methods, we compared 1) immediate freezing at -80oC, 2) storage on ice for 24 or 3) 48 hours. For DNA purification methods, we tested three commercial kits and bead beating in hot phenol. Variations due to the different methodologies were compared to variation among individuals using two approaches--one based on presence-absence information for bacterial taxa (unweighted UniFrac) and the other taking into account their relative abundance (weighted UniFrac). In the unweighted analysis relatively little variation was associated with the different analytical procedures, and variation between individuals predominated. In the weighted analysis considerable variation was associated with the purification methods. Particularly notable was improved recovery of Firmicutes sequences using the hot phenol method. We also carried out surveys of the effects of different 454 sequencing methods (FLX versus Titanium) and amplification of different 16S rRNA variable gene segments. Based on our findings we present recommendations for protocols to collect, process and sequence bacterial 16S rDNA from fecal samples--some major points are 1) if feasible, bead-beating in hot phenol or use of the PSP kit improves recovery; 2) storage methods can be adjusted based on experimental convenience; 3) unweighted (presence-absence) comparisons are less affected by lysis method.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of genome sequencing techniques, traditional research methods based on the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms are being gradually replaced by metagenomics, which is also known as environmental genomics. The first step, which is still a major bottleneck, of metagenomics is the taxonomic characterization of DNA fragments (reads) resulting from sequencing a sample of mixed species. This step is usually referred as "binning". Existing binning methods are based on supervised or semi-supervised approaches which rely heavily on reference genomes of known microorganisms and phylogenetic marker genes. Due to the limited availability of reference genomes and the bias and instability of marker genes, existing binning methods may not be applicable in many cases. RESULTS: In this paper, we present an unsupervised binning method based on the distribution of a carefully selected set of l-mers (substrings of length l in DNA fragments). From our experiments, we show that our method can accurately bin DNA fragments with various lengths and relative species abundance ratios without using any reference and training datasets. Another feature of our method is its error robustness. The binning accuracy decreases by less than 1\% when the sequencing error rate increases from 0\% to 5\%. Note that the typical sequencing error rate of existing commercial sequencing platforms is less than 2\%. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a new and effective tool to solve the metagenome binning problem without using any reference datasets or markers information of any known reference genomes (species). The source code of our software tool, the reference genomes of the species for generating the test datasets and the corresponding test datasets are available at http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/.}

	abstract = {The DNA sequence diversities for microbial communities in four soils affected by agricultural chemicals (mainly triadimefon and ammonium bicarbonate and their intermediates) were evaluated by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Fourteen random primers were used to amplify RAPDs from four soil microbial community DNAs. The products of 12 primers were separated in gel and generated 155 reliable fragments, of which 134 were polymorphic. The richness, modified richness, Shannon-Weaver index, and a similarity coefficient of DNA were calculated to quantify the diversity to access DNA sequence diversities for four soil microbial communities. The results showed that agricultural chemicals affected soil microbial community diversity at the DNA level. The four soil microbial communities were distinguishable in terms of DNA sequence richness, modified richness, Shannon-Weaver index, and coefficient of DNA similarity. Analysis also showed that the amounts of organic C and microbial biomass C were low in the soil polluted by pesticide (mainly triadimefon and its intermediates), but high in the soil polluted by chemical fertilizer (mainly ammonium bicarbonate and its intermediates). The above results combined may indicate that pesticide pollution caused a decrease in the soil microbial biomass but kept high diversity at DNA level, compared with the control without chemical pollution. In contrast, chemical fertilizer pollution caused an increase in the soil biomass but decrease in the DNA diversity. The RAPD marker technique combined with analysis of soil microbial biomass appears to be an effective approach for studying the diversity of soil microbial communities, although the effects of PCR bias on community composition, such as dominating and rare populations in soils, on the diversity needed to be addressed further. </hea}

The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (omega = d(N)d(S)) is an important indicator of selective pressure at the protein level, with omega = 1 meaning neutral mutations, omega < 1 purifying selection, and omega > 1 diversifying positive selection. Amino acid sites in a protein are expected to be under different selective pressures and have different underlying omega ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous omega ratios among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding DNA sequences. These models are useful for testing for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear, mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions of omega among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure indicated by the omega ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected in several genes in which the average omega ratio across sites is <1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection with omega > 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the beta-globin gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A, and HIV-1 env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively selected sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to the specific distributional form assumed for omega and can be achieved using any of several models we implement. However, we encountered difficulties in estimating the precise distribution of omega among sites from real data sets.}

	abstract = {Metagenomics projects based on shotgun sequencing of populations of micro-organisms yield insight into protein families. We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A total of 3,995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are identified, out of which 1,700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin, thus reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in the GOS dataset and current protein databases show distinct biases. Several protein domains that were previously categorized as kingdom specific are shown to have GOS examples in other kingdoms. About 6,000 sequences (ORFans) from the literature that heretofore lacked similarity to known proteins have matches in the GOS data. The GOS dataset is also used to improve remote homology detection. Overall, besides nearly doubling the number of current proteins, the predicted GOS proteins also add a great deal of diversity to known protein families and shed light on their evolution. These observations are illustrated using several protein families, including phosphatases, proteases, ultraviolet-irradiation DNA damage repair enzymes, glutamine synthetase, and RuBisCO. The diversity added by GOS data has implications for choosing targets for experimental structure characterization as part of structural genomics efforts. Our analysis indicates that new families are being discovered at a rate that is linear or almost linear with the addition of new sequences, implying that we are still far from discovering all protein families in nature.}

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing-based 16S rRNA gene surveys are increasingly utilized to study highly diverse bacterial communities, with special emphasis on utilizing the large number of sequences obtained (tens to hundreds of thousands) for species richness estimation. However, it is not yet clear how the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and, hence, species richness estimates determined using shorter fragments at different taxonomic cutoffs correlates with the number of OTUs assigned using longer, nearly complete 16S rRNA gene fragments. We constructed a 16S rRNA clone library from an undisturbed tallgrass prairie soil (1,132 clones) and used it to compare species richness estimates obtained using eight pyrosequencing candidate fragments (99 to 361 bp in length) and the nearly full-length fragment. Fragments encompassing the V1 and V2 (V1+V2) region and the V6 region (generated using primer pairs 8F-338R and 967F-1046R) overestimated species richness; fragments encompassing the V3, V7, and V7+V8 hypervariable regions (generated using primer pairs 338F-530R, 1046F-1220R, and 1046F-1392R) underestimated species richness; and fragments encompassing the V4, V5+V6, and V6+V7 regions (generated using primer pairs 530F-805R, 805F-1046R, and 967F-1220R) provided estimates comparable to those obtained with the nearly full-length fragment. These patterns were observed regardless of the alignment method utilized or the parameter used to gauge comparative levels of species richness (number of OTUs observed, slope of scatter plots of pairwise distance values for short and nearly complete fragments, and nonparametric and parametric species richness estimates). Similar results were obtained when analyzing three other datasets derived from soil, adult Zebrafish gut, and basaltic formations in the East Pacific Rise. Regression analysis indicated that these observed discrepancies in species richness estimates within various regions could readily be explained by the proportions of hypervariable, variable, and conserved base pairs within an examined fragment.}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing makes it possible to rapidly obtain thousands of 16S rDNA sequences from environmental samples. Bioinformatic tools for the analyses of large 16S rDNA sequence databases are needed to comprehensively describe and compare these datasets. RESULTS: FastGroupII is a web-based bioinformatics platform to dereplicate large 16S rDNA libraries. FastGroupII provides users with the option of four different dereplication methods, performs rarefaction analysis, and automatically calculates the Shannon-Wiener Index and Chao1. FastGroupII was tested on a set of 16S rDNA sequences from coral-associated Bacteria. The different grouping algorithms produced similar, but not identical, results. This suggests that 16S rDNA datasets need to be analyzed in multiple ways when being used for community ecology studies. CONCLUSION: FastGroupII is an effective bioinformatics tool for the trimming and dereplication of 16S rDNA sequences. Several standard diversity indices are calculated, and the raw sequences are prepared for downstream analyses.}

In this chapter, we show how to use CodonExplorer, a web tool and interactive database that contains millions of genes, to better understand the principles governing evolution at the single gene and whole-genome level. We present principles and practical procedures for using analyses of GC content and codon usage frequency to identify highly expressed or horizontally transferred genes and to study the relative contribution of different types of mutation to gene and genome composition. CodonExplorer's combination of a user-friendly web interface and a comprehensive genomic database makes these diverse analyses fast and straightforward to perform. CodonExplorer is thus a powerful tool that facilitates and automates a wide range of compositional analyses.}

	abstract = {Detecting patterns of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in genomic sequences is an important problem, with implications for evolution, ecology, biotechnology and medicine. Extensive genetic, biochemical and genomic studies have provided a good understanding of sequence features that are associated with many (though not all) known mobile elements and mechanisms of gene transfer. This information, however, is not currently incorporated into automated methods for gene transfer detection in genomic data. In this review, we argue that automated annotation of sequence features associated with gene transfer mechanisms could be used both to build more sensitive, mechanism-specific compositional models for the detection of some types of HGT in genomic data, and to ask new questions about the classes of genes most frequently transferred by each mechanism. We then summarize the genes and sequence features associated with different mechanisms of horizontal transfer, emphasizing those that are most useful for distinguishing types of transfer when examining genomic data, and noting those classes of transfers that cannot be distinguished in genomic data using existing techniques. Finally, we describe software, databases and algorithms for identifying particular classes of mobile elements, and outline prospects for better detection of HGT based on specific mechanisms of transfer.}

	abstract = {The mammalian gut is an attractive model for exploring the general question of how habitat impacts the evolution of gene content. Therefore, we have characterized the relationship between 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity and overall levels of gene conservation in four groups of species: gut specialists and cosmopolitans, each of which can be divided into pathogens and non-pathogens. At short phylogenetic distances, specialist or cosmopolitan bacteria found in the gut share fewer genes than is typical for genomes that come from non-gut environments, but at longer phylogenetic distances gut bacteria are more similar to each other than are genomes at equivalent evolutionary distances from non-gut environments, suggesting a pattern of short-term specialization but long-term convergence. Moreover, this pattern is observed in both pathogens and non-pathogens, and can even be seen in the plasmids carried by gut bacteria. This observation is consistent with the finding that, despite considerable interpersonal variation in species content, there is surprising functional convergence in the microbiome of different humans. Finally, we observe that even within bacterial species or genera 16S rRNA divergence provides useful information about average conservation of gene content. The results described here should be useful for guiding strain selection to maximize novel gene discovery in large-scale genome sequencing projects, while the approach could be applied in studies seeking to understand the effects of habitat adaptation on genome evolution across other body habitats or environment types.}

A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.}

	abstract = {Large-scale analysis of the GC-content distribution at the gene level reveals both common features and basic differences in genomes of different groups of species. Sharp changes in GC content are detected at the transcription boundaries for all species analyzed, including human, mouse, rat, chicken, fruit fly, and worm. However, two substantially distinct groups of GC-content profiles can be recognized: warm-blooded vertebrates including human, mouse, rat, and chicken, and invertebrates including fruit fly and worm. In vertebrates, sharp positive and negative spikes of GC content are observed at the transcription start and stop sites, respectively, and there is also a progressive decrease in GC content from the 5' untranslated region to the 3' untranslated region along the gene. In invertebrates, the positive and negative GC-content spikes at the transcription start and stop sites are preceded by spikes of opposite value, and the highest GC content is found in the coding regions of the genes. Cross-correlation analysis indicates high frequencies of GC-content spikes at transcription start and stop sites. The strong conservation of this genomic feature seen in comparisons of the human/mouse and human/rat orthologs, and the clustering of genes with GC-content spikes on chromosomes imply a biological function. The GC-content spikes at transcription boundaries may reflect a general principle of genomic punctuation. Our analysis also provides means for identifying these GC-content spikes in individual genomic sequences.}

Many RNA viruses are known to be associated with gastroenteritis; however, the enteric RNA viral community present in healthy humans has not been described. Here, we present a comparative metagenomic analysis of the RNA viruses found in three fecal samples from two healthy human individuals. For this study, uncultured viruses were concentrated by tangential flow filtration, and viral RNA was extracted and cloned into shotgun viral cDNA libraries for sequencing analysis. The vast majority of the 36,769 viral sequences obtained were similar to plant pathogenic RNA viruses. The most abundant fecal virus in this study was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), which was found in high concentrations-up to 10(9) virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter. PMMV was also detected in 12 (66.7\%) of 18 fecal samples collected from healthy individuals on two continents, indicating that this plant virus is prevalent in the human population. A number of pepper-based foods tested positive for PMMV, suggesting dietary origins for this virus. Intriguingly, the fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants, suggesting that humans might act as a vehicle for the dissemination of certain plant viruses.}

In this study, the main factors shaping codon usage in the genome of B. mallei ATCC 23344 were firstly reported. The results showed that the primary trend in codon usage variation in the B. mallei is due to translational selection; while compositional mutation bias is relatively the weaker influence and the hydrophobicity of each protein and gene length are only the minor influences. At the same time, 21 codons defined firstly as 'optimal codons' might provide more useful information for the expression of target genes and development of a vaccine to prevent glanders.}

	abstract = {Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel virus which can cause respiratory tract disease in infants or children. In this study, the codon usage bias and the base composition variations in the available 11 complete HBoV genome sequences have been investigated. Although, there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different HBoV genes, codon usage bias in HBoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. The results of correspondence analysis (COA) and Spearman's rank correlation analysis reveals that the G+C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in HBoV and the gene's function also contributes to the codon usage in this virus. Moreover, it was found that the hydrophobicity of each protein and the gene length are also critical in affecting these viruses' codon usage, although they were less important than that of the mutational bias and the genes' function. At last, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of 44 genes from these 11 HBoV isolates is analyzed using a hierarchical cluster method. The result suggests that genes with same function yet from different isolates are classified into the same lineage and it does not depend on geographical location. These conclusions not only can offer an insight into the codon usage patterns and gene classification of HBoV, but also may help in increasing the efficiency of gene delivery/expression systems.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Each genome has a stable distribution of the combined frequency for each k-mer and its reverse complement measured in sequence fragments as short as 1000 bps across the whole genome, for 1<k<6. The collection of these k-mer frequency distributions is unique to each genome and termed the genome's barcode. RESULTS: We found that for each genome, the majority of its short sequence fragments have highly similar barcodes while sequence fragments with different barcodes typically correspond to genes that are horizontally transferred or highly expressed. This observation has led to new and more effective ways for solving two challenging problems: metagenome binning problem and identification of horizontally transferred genes. Our barcode-based metagenome binning algorithm substantially improves the state of the art in terms of both binning accuracies and the scope of applicability. Other attractive properties of genomes barcodes include (a) the barcodes have different and identifiable characteristics for different classes of genomes like prokaryotes, eukaryotes, mitochondria and plastids, and (b) barcodes similarities are generally proportional to the genomes' phylogenetic closeness. CONCLUSIONS: These and other properties of genomes barcodes make them a new and powerful tool for studying numerous genome and metagenome analysis problems.}

	abstract = {SUMMARY: Huge amount of metagenomic sequence data have been produced as a result of the rapidly increasing efforts world-wide in studying microbial communities as a whole. Most, if not all, sequenced metagenomes are complex mixtures of chromosomal and plasmid sequence fragments from multiple organisms, possibly from different kingdoms. Computational methods for prediction of genomic elements such as genes are significantly different for chromosomes and plasmids, hence raising the need for separation of chromosomal from plasmid sequences in a metagenome. We present a program for classification of a metagenome set into chromosomal and plasmid sequences, based on their distinguishing penta-mer frequencies. On a large training set consisting of all the sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids, the program achieves ~92\% in classification accuracy. On a large set of simulated metagenomes with sequence lengths ranging from 300 bps to 100k bps, the program has classification accuracy from 64.45\% to 88.75\%. On a large independent test set, the program achieves 88.29\% classification accuracy. AVAILABILITY: The program has been implemented as a standalone prediction program, cBar, which is available at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~ffzhou/cBar. CONTACT: xyn\@bmb.uga.edu.}

	abstract = {Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA (16S) variable tags has become the most popular method for assessing microbial diversity, but the method remains costly for the evaluation of large numbers of environmental samples with high sequencing depths. We developed a barcoded Illumina paired-end (PE) sequencing (BIPES) method that sequences each 16S V6 tag from both ends on the Illumina HiSeq 2000, and the PE reads are then overlapped to obtain the V6 tag. The average accuracy of Illumina single-end (SE) reads was only 97.9\%, which decreased from ∼99.9\% at the start of the read to less than 85\% at the end of the read; nevertheless, overlapping of the PE reads significantly increased the sequencing accuracy to 99.65\% by verifying the 3' end of each SE in which the sequencing quality was degraded. After the removal of tags with two or more mismatches within the medial 40-70 bases of the reads and of tags with any primer errors, the overall base sequencing accuracy of the BIPES reads was further increased to 99.93\%. The BIPES reads reflected the amounts of the various tags in the initial template, but long tags and high GC tags were underestimated. The BIPES method yields 20-50 times more 16S V6 tags than does pyrosequencing in a single-flow cell run, and each of the BIPES reads costs less than 1/40 of a pyrosequencing read. As a laborsaving and cost-effective method, BIPES can be routinely used to analyze the microbial ecology of both environmental and human microbiomes.}
