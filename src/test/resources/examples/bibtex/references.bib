@techreport{anthony07quality,
	Abstract = {
    New forms of production based in electronic technology, such as
    open-source and open-content production, convert private commodities
    (typically software) into essentially public goods. A number of
    studies find that, like in other collective goods, incentives for
    reputation and group identity motivate contributions to open source
    goods, thereby overcoming the social dilemma inherent in producing
    such goods.  In this paper we examine how contributor motivations
    affect the quality of contributions to the open-content online
    encyclopedia Wikipedia.  We find that quality is associated with
    contributor motivations, but in a surprisingly inconsistent
    way. Registered users' quality increases with more contributions,
    consistent with the idea of participants motivated by reputation and
    commitment to the Wikipedia community.  Surprisingly, however, we find
    the highest quality from the vast numbers of anonymous "Good
    Samaritans" who contribute only once. Our findings that Good
    Samaritans as well as committed "zealots" contribute high quality
    content to Wikipedia suggest that it is the quantity as well as the
    quality of contributors that positively affects the quality of open
    source production.
